, but talks collapsed when owner george < unk > refused to give jordan complete control of basketball operations . <eos>   in february 2010 , it was reported that jordan was seeking majority ownership

johnson had reached an agreement with jordan and his group , mj basketball holdings , to buy the team pending nba approval . on march 17 , the nba board of governors unanimously approved jordan \\'s purchase , making him the first former player ever to become the majority owner of an nba team . it also made him the league \\'s only african @-@ american majority owner . <eos>   during the 2011 nba < unk > , the new york times wrote that jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners wanting to cap the players \\' share of basketball @-@ related income at 50 percent and as low as 47 .

history and records of the original 1988 – 2002 hornets . <eos>   <eos>   = = player profile = = <eos>   <eos>   jordan was a shooting guard who was also capable of playing as a small forward ( the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the washington wizards ) , and as a point guard . jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer . with the bulls , he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds , including two nba finals games and five other playoff contests . his competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash @-@ talk and well @-@ known work ethic . as the bulls organization built the franchise around jordan , management had to trade away players who were not \" tough enough \" to compete with him in practice . to help improve his defense , he spent extra hours studying film of opponents . on offense , he relied more upon instinct and improvisation at game time . noted as a durable player , jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986 – 87 to 2001 – 02 , when he injured his right knee . he played all 82 games nine times . jordan has frequently cited david thompson , walter davis , and jerry west as influences . from the start of his career , jordan was unique among nba players in that he had a special \" love of the game < unk > \" written into his contract , which allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time , anywhere . <eos>   jordan had a versatile offensive game . he was capable of aggressively driving to the basket , as well as drawing < unk > from his opponents at a high rate ; his 8 @,@ 772 free throw attempts are the ninth @-@ highest total of all time . as his career progressed , jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark < unk > jump shot , using his leaping ability to \" fade away \" from block attempts . according to < unk > brown , this move alone made him nearly < unk > . despite media criticism as a \" selfish \" player early in his career , jordan \\'s 5 @.@ 3 assists per game also indicate his willingness to < unk > to his teammates . in later years , the nba shortened its three @-@ point line to 22 feet ( from 23 feet , 9 inches ) , which coupled with jordan \\'s extended shooting range to make him a long @-@ range threat as well — his 3 @-@ point stroke developed from a low 9 / 52 rate ( < unk > ) in his rookie year into a stellar 111 / 260 ( < unk > ) shooter in the 1995 – 96 season . for a guard , jordan was also a good < unk > ( 6 @.@ 2 per game ) . <eos>   in 1988 , jordan was honored with the nba \\'s defensive player of the year award and became the first nba player to win both the defensive player of the year and mvp awards in a career ( since < unk > by < unk > olajuwon , david robinson , and kevin < unk > ; olajuwon is the only player other than jordan to win both during the same season ) . in addition he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard , and combined this with his ball @-@ < unk > ability to become a standout defensive player . he ranks third in nba history in total steals with 2 @,@ < unk > , trailing john stockton and jason < unk > . jerry west often stated that he was more impressed with jordan \\'s defensive contributions than his offensive

talent was clear from his rookie season . in his first game in madison square garden against the new york knicks , jordan received a prolonged standing ovation , a rarity for an opposing player . after jordan scored a playoff record 63 points against the boston celtics on april 20 , 1986 , celtics star larry bird described him as \" god disguised as michael jordan . \" <eos>   jordan led the nba in scoring in 10 seasons ( nba record ) and tied wilt chamberlain \\'s record of seven consecutive scoring titles . he was also a fixture on the nba all @-@ defensive first team , making the roster nine times ( nba record shared with gary < unk > , kevin < unk > and kobe bryant ) . jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30 @.@ 1 and 33 @.@ 4 points per game , respectively . by 1998 , the season of his finals @-@ winning shot against the jazz , he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer . in the regular season , jordan was the bulls \\' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs , jordan would always demand the ball at < unk > time . jordan \\'s total of 5 @,@ < unk > points in the playoffs is the highest in nba history . he retired with 32 @,@ < unk > points in regular season play , placing him fourth on the nba \\'s all @-@ time scoring list behind kareem abdul @-@ jabbar , karl malone , and kobe bryant . <eos>   with five regular @-@ season mvps ( tied for second place with bill russell ; only kareem abdul @-@ jabbar has won more , six ) , six finals mvps ( nba record ) , and three all @-@ star mvps , jordan is the most decorated player ever to play in the nba . jordan finished among the top three in regular @-@ season mvp voting a record 10 times , and was named one of the 50 greatest players in nba history in 1996 . he is one of only seven players in history to win an ncaa championship , an nba championship , and an olympic gold medal ( doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 u.s. men \\'s basketball teams ) . <eos>   many of jordan \\'s contemporaries say that jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time . in 1999 , an espn survey of journalists , athletes and other sports figures ranked jordan the greatest north american athlete of the 20th century , above such < unk > as babe ruth and muhammad ali . jordan placed second to babe ruth in the associated press \\'s december 1999 list of 20th century athletes . in addition , the associated press voted him as the basketball player of the 20th century . jordan has also appeared on the front cover of sports illustrated a record 50 times . in the september 1996 issue of sport , which was the publication \\'s 50th anniversary issue , jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years . <eos>   jordan \\'s athletic leaping ability , highlighted in his back @-@ to @-@ back slam dunk contest championships in 1987 and 1988 , is credited by many with having influenced a generation of young players . several current nba all @-@ stars have stated that they considered jordan their role model while growing up , including lebron james and < unk > wade . in addition , commentators have dubbed a number of next @-@ generation players \" the next michael jordan \" upon their entry to the nba , including < unk > \" penny \" < unk > , grant hill , allen < unk > , kobe bryant , lebron james , vince carter , and < unk > wade . although jordan was a well @-@ rounded player , his \" air jordan \" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills , defense , and < unk > of young players , a fact jordan himself has lamented . <eos>   i think it was the exposure of michael jordan ; the marketing of michael jordan . everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see , which was scoring and < unk > . that michael jordan still played defense and an all @-@ around game , but it was never really publicized . <eos>   although jordan has done much to increase the status of the game , some of his impact on the game \\'s popularity in america appears to be fleeting . television ratings in particular increased only during his time in the league , and finals ratings have not returned to the level reached during his last championship @-@ winning season . <eos>   in august 2009 , the basketball hall of fame in springfield , massachusetts , opened a michael jordan exhibit containing items from his college and nba careers , as well as from the 1992 \" dream team \" . the exhibit also has a batting < unk > to signify jordan \\'s short career in baseball . after jordan received word of his being accepted into the hall of fame , he selected class of 1996 member david thompson to present him . as jordan would later explain during his induction speech in september 2009 , growing up in north carolina , he was not a fan of the tar < unk > , and greatly admired thompson , who played at rival north carolina state . he was inducted into

not until the end of world war i was independence restored and the nation reunited , although the drawing of boundary lines was , of necessity , a contentious issue . independent poland lasted for only 21 years before it was again attacked and divided among foreign powers . <eos>   on 1 september 1939 , germany invaded poland , initiating world war ii in europe , and on 17 september , pursuant to the < unk > @-@ < unk > pact , poland was invaded by the soviet union . subsequently poland was partitioned again – between these two powers – and remained under occupation for most of the war . by 1 october , germany and the soviet union had completely overrun poland , although the polish government never formally surrendered , and the polish underground state , subordinate to the polish government @-@ in @-@ exile , was soon formed . on 8 october , nazi germany annexed the western areas of pre @-@ war poland and , in the remainder of the occupied area , established the general government . the soviet union had to temporarily give up the territorial gains it made in 1939 due to the german invasion of the soviet union , but permanently re @-@ annexed much of this territory after winning it back in mid @-@ 1944 . over the course of the war , poland lost over 20 % of its pre @-@ war population amid an occupation that marked the end of the second polish republic . <eos>

nation and its culture evolved during the course of the war . many german officials and military officers were initially not given any clear guidelines on the treatment of polish cultural institutions , but this quickly changed . immediately following the invasion of poland in september 1939 , the nazi german government implemented the first stages ( the \" small plan \" ) of < unk > ost . the basic policy was outlined by the berlin office of racial policy in a document titled concerning the treatment of the < unk > of the former polish territories , from a racial @-@ political < unk > . slavic people living east of the pre @-@ war german border were to be < unk > , enslaved or eradicated , depending on whether they lived in the territories directly annexed into the german state or in the general government . <eos>   much of the german policy on polish culture was formulated during a meeting between the governor of the general government , hans frank , and nazi minister of propaganda joseph goebbels , at < unk > on 31 october 1939 . goebbels declared that \" the polish nation is not worthy to be called a cultured nation \" . he and frank agreed that opportunities for the poles to experience their culture should be severely restricted : no theaters , cinemas or < unk > ; no access to radio or press ; and no education . frank suggested that the poles should periodically be shown films highlighting the achievements of the third reich and should eventually be addressed only by < unk > . during the following weeks polish schools beyond middle vocational levels were closed , as were theaters and many other cultural institutions . the only polish @-@ language newspaper published in occupied poland was also closed , and the arrests of polish intellectuals began . <eos>   in march 1940 , all cultural activities came under the control of the general government \\'s department of people \\'s education and propaganda ( < unk > für < unk > und propaganda ) , whose name was changed a year later to the \" chief propaganda department \" ( < unk > propaganda ) . further < unk > issued in the spring and early summer reflected policies that had been outlined by frank and goebbels during the previous autumn . one of the department \\'s earliest decrees prohibited the organization of all but the most \" primitive \" of cultural activities without the department \\'s prior approval . < unk > of \" low quality \" , including those of an erotic or pornographic nature , were however an exception — those were to be popularized to appease the population and to show the world the \" real \" polish culture as well as to create the impression that germany was not preventing poles from expressing themselves . german propaganda specialists invited critics from neutral countries to specially organized \" polish \" performances that were specifically designed to be boring or pornographic , and presented them as typical polish cultural activities . polish @-@ german cooperation in cultural matters , such as joint public performances , was strictly prohibited . meanwhile , a compulsory registration scheme for writers and artists was introduced in august 1940 . then , in october , the printing of new polish @-@ language books was prohibited ; existing titles were censored , and often confiscated and withdrawn . <eos>   in 1941 , german policy evolved further , calling for the complete destruction of the polish people , whom the nazis regarded as \" < unk > \" ( < unk > ) . within ten to twenty years , the polish territories under german occupation were to be entirely cleared of ethnic poles and settled by german colonists . the policy was relaxed somewhat in the final years of occupation ( 1943 – 44 ) , in view of german military defeats and the approaching eastern front . the germans hoped that a more lenient cultural policy would lessen unrest and weaken the polish resistance . poles were allowed back into those museums that now supported german propaganda and indoctrination , such as the newly created chopin museum , which emphasized the composer \\'s invented german roots . < unk > on education , theater and music performances were eased . <eos>   given that the second polish republic was a < unk > state , german policies and propaganda also sought to create and encourage conflicts between ethnic groups , < unk > tension between poles and jews , and between poles and < unk > . in < unk > , the germans forced jews to help destroy a monument to a polish hero , tadeusz < unk > , and filmed them committing the act . soon afterward , the germans set fire to a jewish synagogue and filmed polish < unk > , portraying them in propaganda releases as a \" vengeful mob . \" this divisive policy was reflected in the germans \\' decision to destroy polish education , while at the same time , showing relative tolerance toward the ukrainian school system . as the high @-@ ranking nazi official erich koch explained , \" we must do everything possible so that when a pole meets a ukrainian , he will be willing to kill the ukrainian and < unk > , the ukrainian will be willing to kill the pole . \" <eos>   <eos>   = = = = < unk > = = = = <eos>   <eos>   in 1939 , as the occupation regime was being established , the nazis confiscated polish state property and much private property . < unk > art objects were looted and taken to germany , in line with a plan that had been drawn up well in advance of the invasion . the looting was supervised by experts of the ss @-@ < unk > , < unk > units , who were responsible for art , and by experts of < unk > ost , who were responsible for more mundane objects . notable items plundered by the nazis included the altar of < unk > < unk > and paintings by raphael , < unk > , leonardo da vinci , < unk > and < unk > . most of the important art pieces had been \" secured \" by the nazis within six months of september 1939 ; by the end of 1942 , german officials estimated that \" over 90 % \" of the art previously in poland was in their possession . some art was shipped to german museums , such as the planned < unk > in < unk > , while other art became the private property of nazi officials . over 516 @,@ 000 individual art pieces were taken , including 2 @,@ 800 paintings by european painters ; 11 @,@ 000 works by polish painters ; 1 @,@ 400 sculptures , 75 @,@ 000 manuscripts , 25 @,@ 000 maps , and 90 @,@ 000 books ( including over 20 @,@ 000 printed before 1800 ) ; as well as hundreds of thousands of other objects of artistic and

museums , theaters and cinemas — were either closed or designated as \" nur für deutsche \" ( for germans only ) . twenty @-@ five museums and a host of other institutions were destroyed during the war . according to one estimate , by war \\'s end 43 % of the infrastructure of poland \\'s educational and research institutions and 14 % of its museums had been destroyed . according to another , only 105 of pre @-@ war poland \\'s 175 museums survived the war , and just 33 of these institutions were able to reopen . of pre @-@ war poland \\'s 603 scientific institutions , about half were totally destroyed , and only a few survived the war relatively intact . <eos>   many university professors , as well as teachers , lawyers , artists , writers , priests and other members of the polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed , or transported to concentration camps , during operations such as < unk > @-@ < unk > . this particular campaign resulted in the infamous < unk > < unk > and the massacre of lwów professors . during world war ii poland lost 39 % to 45 % of its < unk > and dentists , 26 % to 57 % of its lawyers , 15 % to 30 % of its teachers , 30 % to 40 % of its scientists and university professors , and 18 % to 28 % of its clergy . the jewish intelligentsia was < unk > altogether . the reasoning behind this policy was clearly articulated by a nazi < unk > : \" in my district , [ any pole who ] shows signs of intelligence will be shot . \" <eos>   as part of their program to suppress polish culture , the german nazis attempted to destroy christianity in poland , with a particular emphasis on the roman catholic church . in some parts of occupied poland , poles were restricted , or even forbidden , from attending religious services . at the same time , church property was confiscated , prohibitions were placed on using the polish language in religious services , organizations affiliated with the catholic church were abolished , and it was forbidden to perform certain religious songs — or to read passages of the bible — in public . the worst conditions were found in the < unk > < unk > , which the nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti @-@ religious policies . polish clergy and religious leaders figured prominently among portions of the intelligentsia that were targeted for < unk > . <eos>   to < unk > the rise of a new generation of educated poles , german officials < unk > that the schooling of polish children would be limited to a few years of elementary education . < unk > @-@ ss heinrich < unk > wrote , in a memorandum of may 1940 : \" the sole purpose of this schooling is to teach them simple arithmetic , nothing above the number 500 ; how to write one \\'s name ; and the doctrine that it is divine law to obey the germans .... i do not regard a knowledge of reading as desirable . \" hans frank echoed him : \" the poles do not need universities or secondary schools ; the polish lands are to be converted into an intellectual desert . \" the situation was particularly dire in the former polish territories beyond the general government , which had been annexed to the third reich . the specific policy varied from territory to territory , but in general , there was no polish @-@ language education at all . german policy constituted a crash @-@ germanization of the populace . polish teachers were dismissed , and some were invited to attend \" orientation \" meetings with the new administration , where they were either summarily arrested or executed on the spot . some polish schoolchildren were sent to german schools , while others were sent to special schools where they spent most of their time as unpaid laborers , usually on german @-@ run farms ; speaking polish brought severe punishment . it was expected that polish children would begin to work once they finished their primary education at age 12 to 15 . in the eastern territories not included in the general government ( < unk > < unk > , < unk > < unk > and < unk > ukraine ) many primary schools were closed , and most education was conducted in non @-@ polish languages such as ukrainian , < unk > , and lithuanian . in the < unk > < unk > region , for example , 86 % of the schools that had existed before the war were closed down during the first two years of german occupation , and by the end of the following year that figure had increased to 93 % . <eos>   the state of polish primary schools was somewhat better in the general government , though by the end of 1940 , only 30 % of prewar schools were operational , and only 28 % of prewar polish children attended them . a german police memorandum of august 1943 described the situation as follows : <eos>   pupils sit < unk > together without necessary materials , and often without skilled teaching staff . moreover , the polish schools are closed during at least five months out of the ten months of the school year due to lack of coal or other fuel . of twenty @-@ thirty < unk > school buildings which kraków had before 1939 , today the worst two buildings are used ... every day , pupils have to study in several shifts . under such circumstances , the school day , which normally lasts five hours , is reduced to one hour . <eos>   in the general government , the remaining schools were < unk > to the german educational system , and the number and competence of their polish staff was steadily scaled down . all universities and most secondary schools were closed , if not immediately after the invasion , then by mid @-@ 1940 . by late 1940 , no official polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation , and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the nazi economy . primary schooling was to last for seven years , but the classes in the final two years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week . there was no money for heating of the schools in winter . classes and schools were to be merged , polish teachers dismissed , and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the german minority or to create barracks for german troops . no new polish teachers were to be trained . the educational curriculum was censored ; subjects such as literature , history and geography were removed . old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed . the new educational aims for poles included convincing them that their national fate was < unk > , and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to germans . this was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools , police inspections of student belongings , mass arrests of students and teachers , and the use of students as forced laborers , often by transporting them to germany as seasonal workers . <eos>   the germans were especially active in the destruction of jewish culture in poland ; nearly all of the wooden < unk > there were destroyed . moreover , the sale of jewish literature was banned throughout poland . <eos>   polish literature faced a similar fate in territories annexed by germany , where the sale of polish books was forbidden . the public destruction of polish books was not limited to those seized from libraries , but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes . the last polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943 ; even polish prayer books were confiscated . soon after the occupation began , most libraries were closed ; in kraków , about 80 % of the libraries were closed immediately , while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors . the occupying powers destroyed polish book collections , including the sejm and senate library , the < unk > estate library , the < unk > estate library , the central military library , and the < unk > collection . in 1941 , the last remaining polish public library in the german @-@ occupied territories was closed in warsaw . during the war , warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes , or 30 % of their collections . more than 80 % of these losses were the direct result of < unk > rather than wartime conflict . overall , it is estimated that about 10 million volumes from state @-@ owned libraries and institutions perished during the war . <eos>   polish flags and other symbols were confiscated . the war on the polish language included the tearing down of signs in polish and the banning of polish speech in public places . persons who spoke polish in the streets were often insulted and even physically assaulted . the germanization of place names prevailed . many treasures of polish culture – including memorials , plaques and monuments to national heroes ( e.g. , kraków \\'s adam mickiewicz monument ) – were destroyed . in < unk > , all polish monuments and plaques were torn down . dozens of monuments were destroyed throughout poland . the nazis planned to level entire cities . <eos>   <eos>   = = = = < unk > and propaganda = = = = <eos>   <eos>   the germans prohibited publication of any regular polish @-@ language book , literary study or scholarly paper . in 1940 , several german @-@ controlled printing houses began operating in occupied poland , publishing items such as polish @-@ german dictionaries and antisemitic and < unk > novels . <eos>   < unk > at first targeted books that were considered to be \" serious \" , including scientific and educational texts and texts that were thought to promote polish patriotism ; only fiction that was free of anti @-@ german overtones was permitted . < unk > literature included maps , < unk > and < unk > and french @-@ language publications , including dictionaries . several non @-@ public < unk > of prohibited books were created , and over 1 @,@ 500 polish writers were declared \" dangerous to the german state and culture \" . the index of banned authors included such polish authors as adam mickiewicz , juliusz < unk > , stanisław < unk > , bolesław < unk > , stefan < unk > , < unk > < unk > < unk > , władysław < unk > , stanisław < unk > , julian < unk > , < unk > < unk > , leopold staff , eliza < unk > and maria < unk > . mere possession of such books was illegal and punishable by imprisonment . < unk > @-@ to @-@ door sale of books was banned , and < unk > — which required a license to operate — were either emptied out or closed . <eos>   poles were forbidden , under penalty of death , to own radios . the press was reduced from over 2 @,@ 000 publications to a few dozen , all censored by the germans . all pre @-@ war newspapers were closed , and the few that were published during the occupation were new creations under the total control of the germans . such a thorough destruction of the press was unprecedented in contemporary history . the only officially available reading matter was the propaganda press that was disseminated by the german occupation administration . < unk > , now under the control of the german propaganda machine , saw their programming dominated by nazi german movies , which were preceded by propaganda < unk > . the few polish films permitted to be shown ( about 20 % of the total programming ) were edited to eliminate references to polish national symbols as well as jewish actors and producers . several propaganda films were shot in polish , although no polish films were shown after 1943 . as all profits from polish cinemas were officially directed toward german war production , attendance was discouraged by the polish underground ; a famous underground slogan declared : \" < unk > < unk > < unk > w < unk > \" ( \" only pigs attend the movies \" ) . a similar situation faced theaters , which were forbidden by the germans to produce \" serious \" < unk > . indeed , a number of propaganda pieces were created for theater stages . hence , theatrical productions were also boycotted by the underground . in addition , actors were discouraged from performing in them and warned that they would be labeled as collaborators if they failed to comply . ironically , restrictions on cultural performances were eased in jewish ghettos , given that the germans wished to distract < unk > inhabitants and prevent them from grasping their eventual fate . <eos>   music was the least restricted of cultural activities , probably because hans frank regarded himself as a fan of serious music . in time , he ordered the creation of the orchestra and symphony of the general government in its capital , kraków . numerous musical performances were permitted in < unk > and churches , and the polish underground chose to boycott only the propagandist operas . visual artists , including painters and < unk > , were compelled to register with the german government ; but their work was generally < unk > by the underground , unless it conveyed propagandist themes . < unk > museums were replaced by occasional art exhibitions that frequently conveyed propagandist themes . <eos>   the development of nazi propaganda in occupied poland can be divided into two main phases . initial efforts were directed towards creating a negative image of pre @-@ war poland , and later efforts were aimed at < unk > anti @-@ soviet , antisemitic , and pro @-@ german attitudes . <eos>   <eos>   = = = soviet occupation = = = <eos>   <eos>   after the

goal of < unk > poland \\'s political and cultural life , so that poland would , according to historian niall ferguson , \" cease to exist not merely as a place , but also as an idea \" . <eos>   the soviet authorities regarded service to the prewar polish state as a \" crime against revolution \" and \" counter @-@ revolutionary activity \" and arrested many members of the polish intelligentsia , politicians , civil servants and academics , as well as ordinary persons suspected of posing a threat to soviet rule . more than a million polish citizens were deported to siberia , many to < unk > concentration camps , for years or decades . others died , including over 20 @,@ 000 military officers who perished in the < unk > massacres . <eos>   the soviets quickly < unk > the annexed lands , introducing compulsory < unk > . they proceeded to confiscate , < unk > and < unk > private and state @-@ owned polish property . in the process , they banned political parties and public associations and imprisoned or executed their leaders as \" enemies of the people \" . in line with soviet anti @-@ religious policy , churches and religious organizations were persecuted . on 10 february 1940 , the < unk > unleashed a campaign of terror against \" anti @-@ soviet \" elements in occupied poland . the soviets \\' targets included persons who often traveled abroad , persons involved in overseas correspondence , < unk > , < unk > , red cross workers , refugees , smugglers , priests and members of religious congregations , the nobility , landowners , wealthy merchants , < unk > , < unk > , and hotel and restaurant owners . stalin , like hitler , worked to eliminate polish society . <eos>   the soviet authorities sought to remove all trace of the polish history of the area now under their control . the name \" poland \" was banned . polish monuments were torn down . all institutions of the dismantled polish state , including the lwów university , were closed , then reopened , mostly with new russian directors . soviet communist ideology became paramount in all teaching . polish literature and language studies were dissolved by the soviet authorities , and the polish language was replaced with russian or ukrainian . polish @-@ language books were burned even in the primary schools . polish teachers were not allowed in the schools , and many were arrested . classes were held in < unk > , lithuanian and ukrainian , with a new pro @-@ soviet curriculum . as polish @-@ canadian historian piotr < unk > noted , citing british historians m. r. d. foot and i. c. b. dear , majority of scholars believe that \" in the soviet occupation zone , conditions were only marginally less harsh than under the germans . \" in september 1939 , many polish jews had fled east ; after some months of living under soviet rule , some of them wanted to return to the german zone of occupied poland . <eos>   all publications and media were subjected to censorship . the soviets sought to recruit polish left @-@ wing intellectuals who were willing to cooperate . soon after the soviet invasion , the writers \\' association of soviet ukraine created a local chapter in lwów ; there was a polish @-@ language theater and radio station . polish cultural activities in < unk > and < unk > were less organized . these activities were strictly controlled by the soviet authorities , which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former polish government . <eos>   the soviet propaganda @-@ motivated support for polish @-@ language cultural activities , however , clashed with the official policy of < unk > . the soviets at first intended to phase out the polish language and so banned polish from schools , street signs , and other aspects of life . this policy was , however , reversed at times — first before the elections in october 1939 ; and later , after the german conquest of france . in november 1940 , the poles of lwów observed the 85th anniversary of adam mickiewicz \\'s death . soon , however , stalin decided to re @-@ implement the < unk > policies . he reversed his decision again , however , when a need arose for polish @-@ language pro @-@ soviet propaganda following the german invasion of the soviet union ; as a result stalin permitted the creation of polish forces in the east and later decided to

state created a department of education and culture ( under stanisław < unk > ) which , along with a department of labor and social < unk > ( under jan stanisław < unk > and , later , stefan < unk > ) and a department for < unk > of the effects of war ( under antoni < unk > and < unk > < unk > ) , became underground patrons of polish culture . these < unk > oversaw efforts to save from looting and destruction works of art in state and private collections ( most notably , the giant paintings by jan < unk > that were concealed throughout the war ) . they compiled reports on looted and destroyed works and provided artists and scholars with means to continue their work and their publications and to support their families . thus , they sponsored the underground publication ( < unk > ) of works by winston churchill and < unk > < unk > and of 10 @,@ 000 copies of a polish primary @-@ school < unk > and commissioned artists to create resistance artwork ( which was then disseminated by operation n and like activities ) . also occasionally sponsored were secret art exhibitions , theater performances and concerts . <eos>   other important patrons of polish culture included the roman catholic church and polish < unk > , who likewise supported artists and < unk > polish heritage ( notable patrons included cardinal adam stefan < unk > and a former politician , < unk > < unk > ) . some private publishers , including stefan < unk > , zbigniew < unk > and the < unk > publishing house , paid writers for books that would be delivered after the war . <eos>   <eos>   = = = education = = = <eos>   <eos>   in response to the german closure and censorship of polish schools , resistance among teachers led almost immediately to the creation of large @-@ scale underground educational activities . most notably , the secret teaching organization ( < unk > < unk > < unk > , ton ) was created as early as in october 1939 . other organizations were created locally ; after 1940 they were increasingly subordinated and coordinated by the ton , working closely with the underground \\'s state department of culture and education , which was created in autumn 1941 and headed by < unk > < unk > , creator of the ton . classes were either held under the cover of officially permitted activities or in private homes and other venues . by 1942 , about 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 students took part in underground primary education ; in 1944 , its secondary school system covered 100 @,@ 000 people , and university level courses were attended by about 10 @,@ 000 students ( for comparison , the pre @-@ war enrollment at polish universities was about 30 @,@ 000 for the 1938 / 1939 year ) . more than 90 @,@ 000 secondary @-@ school pupils attended underground classes held by nearly 6 @,@ 000 teachers between 1943 and 1944 in four districts of the general government ( centered on the cities of warsaw , kraków , < unk > and < unk > ) . overall , in that period in the general government , one of every three children was receiving some sort of education from the underground organizations ; the number rose to about 70 % for children old enough to attend secondary school . it is estimated that in some rural areas , the educational coverage was actually improved ( most likely as courses were being organized in some cases by teachers escaped or deported from the cities ) . compared to pre @-@ war classes , the absence of polish jewish students was notable , as they were confined by the nazi germans to ghettos ; there was , however , underground jewish education in the ghettos , often organized with support from polish organizations like ton . students at the underground schools were often also members of the polish resistance . <eos>   in warsaw , there were over 70 underground schools , with 2 @,@ 000 teachers and 21 @,@ 000 students . underground warsaw university educated 3 @,@ 700 students , issuing 64 masters and 7 doctoral degrees . warsaw < unk > under occupation educated 3 @,@ 000 students , issuing 186 engineering degrees , 18 doctoral ones and 16 < unk > . < unk > university issued 468 masters and 62 doctoral degrees , employed over 100 professors and teachers , and served more than 1 @,@ 000 students per year . throughout poland , many other universities and institutions of higher education ( of music , theater , arts , and others ) continued their classes throughout the war . even some academic research was carried out ( for example , by władysław < unk > , a leading polish philosopher , and < unk > < unk > , a linguist ) . nearly 1 @,@ 000 polish scientists received funds from the underground state , enabling them to continue their research . <eos>   the german attitude to underground education varied depending on whether it took place in the general government or the annexed territories . the germans had almost certainly realized the full scale of the polish underground education system by about 1943 , but lacked the manpower to put an end to it , probably < unk > resources to dealing with the armed resistance . for the most part , closing underground schools and colleges in the general government was not a top priority for the germans . in 1943 a german report on education admitted that control of what was being taught in schools , particularly rural ones , was difficult , due to lack of manpower , transportation , and the activities of the polish resistance . some schools semi @-@ openly taught unauthorized subjects in defiance of the german authorities . hans frank noted in 1944 that although polish teachers were a \" mortal enemy \" of the german states , they could not all be disposed of immediately . it was perceived as a much more serious issue in the annexed territories , as it hindered the process of germanization ; involvement in the underground education in those territories was much more likely to result in a sentence to a concentration camp . <eos>   <eos>   = = = print = = = <eos>   <eos>   there were over 1 @,@ 000 underground newspapers ; among the most important were the < unk > < unk > of armia krajowa and < unk > of the government delegation for poland . in addition to publication of news ( from intercepted western radio transmissions ) , there were hundreds of underground publications dedicated to politics , economics , education , and literature ( for example , < unk > i < unk > ) . the highest recorded publication volume was an issue of < unk > < unk > printed in 43 @,@ 000 copies ; average volume of larger publication was 1 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 copies . the polish underground also published < unk > and leaflets from imaginary anti @-@ nazi german organizations aimed at spreading < unk > and lowering morale among the germans . books were also sometimes printed . other items were also printed , such as patriotic posters or fake german administration posters , ordering the germans to evacuate poland or telling poles to register household cats . <eos>   the two largest underground publishers were the bureau of information and propaganda of armia krajowa and the government delegation for poland . < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > ( secret military publishing house ) of jerzy < unk > ( subordinated to the armia krajowa ) was probably the largest underground publisher in the world . in addition to polish titles , armia krajowa also printed false german newspapers designed to decrease morale of the occupying german forces ( as part of action n ) . the majority of polish underground presses were located in occupied warsaw ; until the warsaw uprising in the summer of 1944 the germans found over 16 underground printing presses ( whose crews were usually executed or sent to concentration camps ) . the second largest center for polish underground publishing was kraków . there , writers and editors faced similar dangers : for example , almost the entire editorial staff of the underground satirical paper na < unk > was arrested , and its chief editors were executed in kraków on 27 may 1944 . ( na < unk > was the longest published polish underground paper devoted to satire ; 20 issues were published starting in october 1943 . ) the underground press was supported by a large number of activists ; in addition to the crews manning the printing presses , scores of underground < unk > distributed the publications . according to some statistics , these < unk > were among the underground members most frequently arrested by the germans . <eos>   under german occupation , the professions of polish journalists and writers were virtually eliminated , as they had little opportunity to publish their work . the underground state \\'s department of culture sponsored various initiatives and individuals , enabling them to continue their work and aiding in their publication . novels and anthologies were published by underground presses ; over 1 @,@ 000 works were published underground over the course of the war . literary discussions were held , and prominent writers of the period working in poland included , among others , < unk > kamil < unk > , < unk > < unk > , tadeusz borowski , tadeusz boy @-@ żeleński , maria < unk > , tadeusz < unk > , zuzanna ginczanka , < unk > < unk

theater ( and the virtual end of the polish radio and film industry ) , underground theaters were created , primarily in warsaw and kraków , with shows presented in various underground venues . beginning in 1940 the theaters were coordinated by the secret < unk > council . four large companies and more than 40 smaller groups were active throughout the war , even in the < unk > \\'s < unk > prison in warsaw and in auschwitz ; underground acting schools were also created . underground actors , many of whom officially worked mundane jobs , included karol < unk > , < unk > < unk > , henryk

such as < unk > , < unk > , the most popular song of occupied warsaw . patriotic puppet shows were staged . jewish musicians ( e.g. władysław < unk > ) and artists likewise performed in ghettos and even in concentration camps . although many of them died , some survived abroad , like alexandre < unk > in the united states , and eddie < unk > and henryk wars in the soviet union . <eos>   visual arts were practiced underground as well . < unk > , restaurants and private homes were turned into galleries or museums ; some were closed , with their owners , staff and patrons harassed , arrested or even executed . polish underground artists included < unk > < unk > , stanisław < unk > @-@ < unk > , stanisław < unk > @-@ < unk > , and konstanty maria < unk > . some artists worked directly for the underground state , forging money and documents , and creating anti @-@ nazi art ( satirical posters and caricatures ) or polish patriotic symbols ( for example < unk > ) . these works were reprinted on underground presses , and those intended for public display were plastered to walls or painted on them as graffiti . many of these activities were coordinated under the action n operation of armia krajowa \\'s bureau of information and propaganda . in 1944 three giant ( 6 m , or 20 ft ) puppets , caricatures of hitler and < unk > < unk > , were successfully displayed in public places in warsaw . some artists recorded life and death in occupied poland ; despite german < unk > on poles using cameras , photographs and even films were taken . although it was impossible to operate an underground radio station , underground auditions were recorded and introduced into german radios or loudspeaker systems . underground < unk > stamps were designed and issued . since the germans also

before . \" similarly , close @-@ knit underground classes , from primary schools to universities , were renowned for their high quality , due in large part to the lower ratio of students to teachers . the resulting culture was , however , different from the culture of interwar poland for a number of reasons . the destruction of poland \\'s jewish community , poland \\'s postwar territorial changes , and postwar migrations left poland without its historic ethnic minorities . the < unk > nation was no more . <eos>   the experience of world war ii placed its stamp on a generation of polish artists that became known as the \" generation of < unk > \" . the term denotes an entire generation of poles , born soon after poland regained independence in 1918 , whose adolescence was marked by world war ii . in their art , they \" discovered a new poland \" – one forever changed by the atrocities of world war ii and the ensuing creation of a communist poland . <eos>   over the years , nearly three @-@ quarters of the polish people have emphasized the importance of world war ii to the polish national identity . many polish works of art created since the war have centered on events

operation that resulted in the battle of jutland which took place on 31 may and 1 june 1916 . the german fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the grand fleet and destroy it before the main british fleet could retaliate . markgraf was the third ship in the german line , behind her sisters könig and grosser kurfürst and followed by kronprinz . the four ships made up the v division of the iii battle squadron , and they were the vanguard of the fleet . the iii battle squadron was the first of three battleship units ; directly < unk > were the kaiser @-@ class battleships of the vi division , iii battle squadron . the iii squadron was followed by the < unk > and nassau classes of the ii battle squadron ; in the rear guard were the obsolescent < unk > @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the i battle squadron . <eos>   shortly before 16 : 00 the battlecruisers of i scouting group encountered the british 1st battlecruiser squadron under the command of vice admiral david beatty . the opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of < unk > , shortly after 17 : 00 , and queen mary , less than half an hour later . by this time , the german battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the british ships toward the main body of the high seas fleet . at 17 : 30 , könig \\'s crew spotted both the i scouting group and the 1st battlecruiser squadron approaching . the german battlecruisers were steaming to starboard , while the british ships steamed to port . at 17 : 45 , scheer ordered a two @-@ point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the british battlecruisers , and a minute later , the order to open fire was given . <eos>   markgraf opened fire on the battlecruiser tiger at a range of 21 @,@ 000 yards ( 19 @,@ 000 m ) . markgraf and her two sisters fired their secondary guns on british destroyers attempting to make torpedo attacks against the german fleet . markgraf continued to engage tiger until 18 : 25 , by which time the faster battlecruisers managed to move out of effective gunnery range . during this period , the battleships warspite and valiant of the 5th battle squadron fired on the leading german battleships . at 18 : 10 , one of the british ships scored a 15 @-@ inch ( 38 cm ) shell hit on markgraf . shortly thereafter , the destroyer moresby fired a single torpedo at markgraf and missed from a range of about 8 @,@ 000 yd ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) . malaya fired a torpedo at markgraf at 19 : 05 , but the torpedo missed due to the long range . around the same time , markgraf engaged a cruiser from the 2nd light cruiser squadron before shifting her fire back to the 5th battle squadron for ten minutes . during this period , two more 15 @-@ inch shells hit markgraf , though the timing is unknown . the hit at 18 : 10 struck on a joint between two 8 @-@ inch @-@ thick side armor plates ; the shell burst on impact and holed the armor . the main deck was < unk > and approximately 400 t ( 390 long tons ; 440 short tons ) of water entered the ship . the other two shells failed to explode and caused negligible damage . <eos>   shortly after 19 : 00 , the german cruiser wiesbaden had become disabled by a shell from the british battlecruiser invincible ; rear admiral paul < unk > in könig attempted to position his four ships to cover the stricken cruiser . simultaneously , the british iii and iv light cruiser squadrons began a torpedo attack on the german line ; while advancing to torpedo range , they smothered wiesbaden with fire from their main guns . the obsolescent armored cruisers of the 1st cruiser squadron also joined in the melee . markgraf and her sisters fired heavily on the british cruisers , but even sustained fire from the battleships \\' main guns failed to drive them off . markgraf fired both her 30 @.@ 5 cm and 15 cm guns at the armored cruiser defence . under a hail of fire from the german battleships , defence exploded and sank ; credit is normally given to the battlecruiser lützow , though markgraf \\'s gunners also claimed credit for the sinking . <eos>   markgraf then fired on the battlecruiser princess royal and scored two hits . the first hit struck the 9 @-@ inch armor covering \" x \" barbette , was < unk > downward , and exploded after penetrating the 1 @-@ inch deck armor . the crew for the left gun were killed , the turret was disabled , and the explosion caused serious damage to the upper deck . the second shell penetrated princess royal \\'s 6 @-@ inch belt armor , < unk > upward off the coal bunker , and exploded under the 1 @-@ inch deck armor . the two shells killed 11 and wounded 31 . at the same time , markgraf \\'s secondary guns fired on the cruiser warrior , which was seriously damaged by 15 heavy shells and forced to withdraw . warrior < unk > on the trip back to port the following morning . <eos>   around 19 : 30 , admiral john jellicoe \\'s main force of battleships entered the battle ; orion began firing at markgraf at 19 : 32 ; she fired four salvos of 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch armor @-@ < unk > , < unk > ( < unk > ) shells and scored a hit with the last salvo . the shell exploded upon impacting the armor protecting the no . 6 15 cm gun casemate . the shell failed to penetrate but holed the armor and disabled the gun . the explosion seriously injured two and killed the rest of the gun crew . a heavy shell nearly struck the ship at the same time , and at 19 : 44 , a bent propeller shaft forced markgraf \\'s crew to turn off the port engine ; naval historian john campbell speculated that this shell was the one that damaged the shaft . her speed dropped to 17 or 18 kn ( 31 or 33 km / h ; 20 or 21 mph ) , though she remained in her position in the line . <eos>   shortly after 20 : 00 , the german battleships engaged the 2nd light cruiser squadron ; markgraf fired primarily 15 cm shells . in this period , markgraf was engaged by < unk > \\'s 12 @-@ inch guns , which scored a single hit at 20 : 14 . the shell failed to explode and shattered on impact on the 8 @-@ inch side armor , causing minimal damage . two of the adjoining 14 @-@ inch plates directly below the 8 @-@ inch armor were slightly forced inward and some minor flooding occurred . the heavy fire of the british fleet forced scheer to order the fleet to turn away . due to her reduced speed , markgraf turned early in an attempt to maintain her place in the battle line ; this , however , forced grosser kurfürst to fall out of formation . markgraf fell in behind kronprinz while grosser kurfürst steamed ahead to return to her position behind könig . after successfully withdrawing from the british , scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation , though communication errors between scheer aboard friedrich der < unk > and < unk > , the lead ship , caused delays . several british light cruisers and destroyers stumbled into the german line around 21 : 20 . in the ensuing short engagement markgraf hit the cruiser < unk > five times with her secondary guns . the fleet fell into formation by 23 : 30 , with grosser kurfürst the 13th vessel in the line of 24 capital ships . <eos>   around 02 : 45 , several british destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the german line . markgraf initially held her fire as the identities of the destroyers were unknown . but gunners aboard grosser kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes , which prompted markgraf to follow suit . heavy fire from the german battleships forced the british destroyers to withdraw . at 05 : 06 , markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine . <eos>   the high seas fleet managed to punch through the british light forces without drawing the attention of jellicoe \\'s battleships , and subsequently reached horns reef by 04 : 00 on 1 june . upon reaching wilhelmshaven , markgraf went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer < unk > . the ship was transferred to hamburg where she was repaired in ag vulcan \\'s large floating dock . repair work was completed by 20 july . in the course of the battle , markgraf had fired a total of 254 shells from her main battery and < unk > rounds from her 15 cm guns . she was hit by five large @-@ caliber shells , which killed 11 men and wounded 13 . <eos>   <eos>   = = = subsequent operations = = = <eos>   <eos>   following repairs in july 1916 , markgraf went into the baltic for trials . the ship was then temporarily assigned to the i scouting group for the fleet operation on 18 – 19 august . due to the serious damage incurred by seydlitz and derfflinger at jutland , the only battlecruisers available for the operation were von der < unk > and moltke , which were joined by markgraf , grosser kurfürst , and the new battleship bayern . the british were aware of the german plans , and sortied the grand fleet to meet them . by 14 : 35 , scheer had been warned of the grand fleet \\'s approach and , unwilling to engage the whole of the grand fleet just 11 weeks after the < unk > close engagement at jutland , turned his forces around and retreated to german ports . <eos>   markgraf was present for the uneventful advance in the direction of sunderland on 18 – 20 october . unit training with the iii squadron followed from 21 october to 2 november . two days later , the ship formally rejoined iii squadron . on the 5th , a pair of u @-@ boats grounded on the danish coast . light forces were sent to recover the vessels , and iii squadron , which was in the north sea en route to wilhelmshaven , was ordered to cover them . during the operation , the british submarine < unk > torpedoed both grosser kurfürst and kronprinz and caused moderate damage . for most of 1917 , markgraf was occupied with guard duties in the north sea , interrupted only by a refit period in january and periodic unit training in the baltic . <eos>   <eos>   = = = operation albion = = = <eos>   <eos>   in early september 1917 , following the german conquest of the russian port of riga , the german navy decided to eliminate the russian naval forces that still held the gulf of riga . the < unk > ( navy high command ) planned an operation to seize the baltic island of ösel , and specifically the russian gun batteries on the < unk > peninsula . on 18 september , the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture ösel and moon islands ; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship , moltke , along with the iii and iv battle squadrons of the high seas fleet . the ii squadron consisted of the four könig @-@ class ships , and was by this time augmented with the new battleship bayern . the iv squadron consisted of the five kaiser @-@ class battleships . along with nine light cruisers , three torpedo boat flotillas , and dozens of mine warfare ships , the entire force numbered some 300 ships , supported by over 100 aircraft and six < unk > . the invasion force amounted to approximately 24 @,@ 600 officers and enlisted men . <eos>   < unk > the germans were the old russian pre @-@ dreadnoughts < unk > and < unk > , the armored cruisers bayan , admiral < unk > , and diana , 26 destroyers , and several torpedo boats and gunboats . three british c @-@ class submarines where also stationed in the gulf . the < unk > strait , the main southern entrance to the gulf of riga , was heavily mined and defended by a number of coastal artillery batteries . the garrison on ösel numbered nearly 14 @,@ 000 men , though by 1917 it had been reduced to 60 to 70 percent strength . <eos>   the operation began on 12 october , when moltke and the four könig @-@ class ships covered the landing of ground troops by suppressing the shore batteries covering < unk > bay . markgraf fired on the battery located on cape < unk > . after the successful amphibious assault , iii squadron steamed to < unk > < unk > , although markgraf remained behind for several days . on the 17th , markgraf left < unk > bay to rejoin her squadron in the gulf of riga , but early on the following morning she ran aground at the entrance to < unk > . the ship was quickly freed , and she reached the iii squadron anchorage north of < unk > bank on the 19th . the next day , markgraf steamed to moon sound , and on the 25th participated in the bombardment of russian positions on the island of < unk > . the ship returned to < unk > on 27 october , and two days later was detached from operation albion to return to the north sea . <eos>   markgraf struck a pair of mines in quick succession while in the < unk > strait and took in 260 metric tons ( 260 long tons ; 290 short tons ) of water . the ship continued on to kiel via < unk > in danzig ; she then went on to wilhelmshaven , where the mine damage was repaired . the work was completed at the imperial dockyard from 6 to 23 november . after repairs were completed , markgraf returned to guard duty in the north sea . she missed an attempted raid on a british convoy on 23 – 25 april 1918 , as she was in dock in kiel from 15 march to 5 may for the installation of a new foremast . <eos>   <eos>   = = = fate = = = <eos>   <eos>   markgraf and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of october 1918 , days before the armistice was to take effect . the bulk of the high seas fleet was to have sortied from their base in wilhelmshaven to engage the british grand fleet . scheer — by now the grand admiral ( < unk > ) of the fleet — intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the british navy in order to obtain a better < unk > position for germany , despite the expected casualties . however , many of the war @-@ weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war . on the morning of 29 october 1918 , the order was given to sail from wilhelmshaven the following day . starting on the night of 29 october , sailors on < unk > and then on several other battleships , including markgraf , mutinied . the unrest ultimately forced hipper and scheer to cancel the operation . < unk > of the situation , the kaiser stated , \" i no longer have a navy . \" <eos>   following the capitulation of germany in november 1918 , most of the high seas fleet ships , under the command of rear admiral ludwig von reuter , were interned in the british naval base in scapa flow . prior to the departure of the german fleet , admiral adolf von < unk > made clear to von reuter that he could not allow the allies to seize the ships , under any conditions . the fleet rendezvoused with the british light cruiser cardiff , which led the ships to the allied fleet that was to escort the germans to scapa flow . the massive flotilla consisted of some 370 british , american , and french warships . once the ships were interned , their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks , and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men . <eos>   the fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the treaty of versailles . von reuter believed that the british intended to seize the german ships on 21 june 1919 , which was the deadline for germany to have signed the peace treaty . < unk > that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd , reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the first opportunity . on the morning of 21 june , the british fleet left scapa flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 reuter transmitted the order to his ships . markgraf sank at 16 : 45 . the british soldiers in the guard detail < unk > in their attempt to prevent the germans from scuttling the ships ; they shot and killed markgraf \\'s captain , walter schumann , who was in a lifeboat , and an enlisted man . in total , the guards killed nine germans and wounded twenty @-@ one . the remaining crews , totaling some 1 @,@ 860 officers and enlisted men , were imprisoned . <eos>   markgraf was never raised for scrapping , unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled . markgraf and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships , which made any salvage attempt more difficult . the outbreak of world war ii in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations , and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical . the rights to future salvage operations on the wrecks were sold to britain in 1962 . owing to the fact that the steel that composed their hulls was produced before the advent of nuclear weapons , markgraf and her sisters are among the few accessible sources of low @-@ background steel , which has occasionally been removed for use in scientific devices . markgraf and the other vessels on the bottom of scapa flow are a popular dive site , and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks . <eos>   <eos>   <eos>   = coldrum long barrow = <eos>   <eos>   the coldrum long barrow , also known as the coldrum stones and the < unk > stones , is a chambered long barrow located near to the village of trottiscliffe in the south @-@ eastern english county of kent . < unk > circa 4000 bce , during britain \\'s early neolithic period , today it survives only in a ruined state . <eos>   archaeologists have established that the monument was built by < unk > communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to britain from continental europe . although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across neolithic europe , the coldrum stones belong to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the river medway , now known as the medway megaliths . of these , it is in the best surviving condition , and lies near to both addington long barrow and chestnuts long barrow on the western side of the river . three further surviving long barrows , kit \\'s coty house , the little kit \\'s coty house , and the coffin stone , are located on the medway \\'s eastern side . <eos>   built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths , the long barrow consisted of a sub @-@ rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb @-@ stones . within the eastern end of the tumulus was a stone chamber , into which human remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the early neolithic . < unk > analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals , a mixture of men , women , children and adults . at least one of the bodies had been < unk > prior to burial , potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of < unk > and secondary burial . as with other barrows , coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead , perhaps as part of a belief system involving ancestor veneration , although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious , ritual , and cultural connotations and uses . <eos>   after the early neolithic , the long barrow fell into a state of ruined < unk > , perhaps experiencing deliberate deposition in the late medieval period , either by christian < unk > or treasure hunters . local folklore grew up around the site , associating it with the burial of a prince and the countless stones motif . the ruin attracted the interest of < unk > in the 19th century , while archaeological excavation took place in the early 20th . after limited reconstruction , in 1926 ownership was transferred to heritage charity the national trust . it is open without charge to visitors all year around . <eos>   <eos>   = = name and location = = <eos>   <eos>   the coldrum stones are named after a nearby

track known as the pilgrim \\'s way . the tomb can be reached along a pathway known as coldrum lane , which is only accessible on foot . the nearest car park to coldrum lane can be found off of < unk

= = <eos>   <eos>   the early neolithic was a revolutionary period of british history . beginning in the fifth millennium bce , it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the british isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence , abandoning the hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding mesolithic period . archaeologists have been unable to prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental europe or because the indigenous mesolithic britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies . either way , it certainly emerged through contact with continental europe , probably as a result of centuries of interaction between mesolithic people living in south @-@ east britain and linear < unk > culture ( < unk > ) communities in north @-@ eastern france . the region of modern kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental european settlers and visitors , because of its position on the estuary of the river thames and its proximity to the continent . <eos>   between < unk > and < unk > bce , all of the british isles came to abandon its former mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle , to be replaced by the new agricultural subsistence of the neolithic age . although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the british isles in this period , there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement , architectural styles , and the use of natural resources . throughout most of britain , there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period , leading archaeologists to believe that the early neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral , relying on herding cattle , with people living a nomadic or semi @-@ nomadic way of life . although witnessing some land clearance , britain was largely forested in this period , and it is unclear what level of < unk > the area of kent had experienced in the early neolithic ; widespread forest clearance only took place on the < unk > of south @-@ east britain in the late bronze age . environmental data from the area around the white horse stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the early neolithic , covered by a woodland of oak , ash , < unk > / alder and < unk > . <eos>   <eos>   = = = the tomb building tradition = = = <eos>   <eos>   across western europe , the early neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape . these were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead , and though sometimes constructed out of timber , many were built using large stones , now known as \" megaliths \" . individuals were rarely buried alone in the early neolithic , instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community . the construction of these collective burial monumental tombs , both wooden and megalithic , began in continental europe before being adopted in britain in the first half of the fourth millennium bce . <eos>   the early neolithic people of britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their mesolithic forebears had done . many archaeologists have suggested that this is because early neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead , believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants . archaeologist robin < unk > stressed that rather than simply being tombs , the medway megaliths were \" communal < unk > fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them . \" thus , it has furthermore been suggested that early neolithic people entered into the tombs – which doubled as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance . for this reason , historian ronald hutton termed these monuments \" tomb @-@ shrines \" to reflect their dual purpose . <eos>   in britain , these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape , perhaps at the junction between different territories . archaeologist caroline malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on \" territory , political allegiance , ownership , and ancestors . \" many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb @-@ shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups , although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society . instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways . many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land , thus representing a change in mindset brought about by < unk > . others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherers . <eos>   archaeologists have differentiated these early neolithic tombs into a variety of different architectural styles , each typically associated with a different region within the british isles . passage graves , characterised by their narrow passage made of large stones and one or multiple burial chambers covered in earth or stone , were predominantly located in northern britain and southern and central ireland . < unk > , across northern ireland and central britain long chambered mounds predominated , while in the east and south @-@ east of britain , earthen long barrows represented the dominant architectural trend . these earthen long barrows were typically constructed of timber because building stone was scarce in southern britain ; archaeologist aubrey < unk > argued that these timber tombs might have been \" even more eye @-@ catching \" than their stone counterparts , perhaps consisting of \" towering carved poles , < unk > painted \" , but that evidence of such sculptures has not survived . the medway megaliths represent just one of these regional groups within the wider west european tradition of tomb building in this period . <eos>   <eos>   = = = the medway megaliths = = = <eos>   <eos>   although now all in a ruinous state and not retaining their original appearance , at the time of construction the medway megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing early neolithic funerary monuments in britain . < unk > along the river medway as it cuts through the north downs , they constitute the most south @-@ easterly group of megalithic monuments in the british isles , and the only megalithic group in eastern england . archaeologists brian < unk > and mike < unk > deemed the medway megaliths to be \" some of the most interesting and well known \" archaeological sites in kent , while archaeologist paul ashbee described them as \" the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern england \" . <eos>   they can be divided into two separate clusters : one to the west of the river medway and the other on blue bell hill to the east , with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10 km . the western group includes coldrum long barrow , addington long barrow , and the chestnuts long barrow . the eastern group consists of kit \\'s coty house , little kit \\'s coty house , the coffin stone , and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs . it is not known if they were all built at the same time , or whether they were constructed in succession , while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage . <eos>   the medway long barrows all < unk > to the same general design plan , and are all aligned on an east to west axis . each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound , and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance . the chambers were constructed from sarsen , a dense , hard , and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout kent , having formed out of < unk > sand from the < unk > . early neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area , and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected . <eos>   such common architectural features among these tomb @-@ shrines indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the british isles . for instance , they would have been taller than most other tomb @-@ shrines in britain , with internal heights of up to 10 ft . nevertheless , as with other regional groupings of early neolithic tomb @-@ shrines ( such as the cotswold @-@ severn group ) , there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments , such as coldrum \\'s rectilinear shape , the < unk > long barrow \\'s facade , and the long , thin mounds at addington and kit \\'s coty . this variation might have been caused by the tomb @-@ shrines being altered and adapted over the course of their use ; in this scenario , the monuments would represent composite structures . <eos>   it seems apparent that the people who built these monuments were influenced by pre @-@ existing tomb @-@ shrines that they were already aware of . whether those people had grown up locally , or moved into the medway area from elsewhere is not known . based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs , stuart piggott thought that they had originated in the area around the low countries , while glyn daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from scandinavia . john h. evans instead suggested an origin in germany , and ronald f. < unk > thought that their origins could be seen in the cotswold @-@ severn megalithic group . ashbee noted that their close < unk > in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb @-@ shrine traditions of continental northern europe , and emphasised that the medway megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across early neolithic europe . he nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was \" impossible to indicate \" with the available evidence . <eos>   <eos>   = = design and construction = = <eos>   <eos>   the monument originally consisted of a sarsen stone chamber , covered by a low earthen mound , which was bounded by prostrate slabs . as such , the archaeologist paul ashbee asserted that the monument could be divided into three particular features : the chamber , the barrow , and the sarsen stone surround . it is located on the edge of a large < unk > < unk > , although it is difficult to < unk > what views would have been possible from the monument at the time of construction , due to a lack of information on how densely forested the vicinity was . however , if the area was not highly wooded , then 360 ° views of the surrounding landscape would have been possible . the monument \\'s axis points toward both the north downs and the medway valley , which is similar to the other medway megaliths . archaeologist < unk > < unk > suggested that the coldrum long barrow might have been built within view of a nearby settlement , and that this \" may have been a key factor in the experience of ceremonies and rituals taking place at the tombs and may also have defined a link between the tomb builders and the landscape . \" <eos>   it had been built using about 50 stones . the barrow is sub @-@ rectangular in plan , and about 20 meters ( 64 feet ) in length . at its broader , eastern end , where the chamber is located , the monument measures 15 metres ( 50 feet ) , while at the narrower , western end , it is 12 metres ( 40 feet ) in breadth . as such , the barrow is a \" truncated wedge @-@ shape \" . the megalithic builders responsible for the coldrum stones positioned it on the top of a small ridge adjacent to the north downs , and constructed it facing eastward , towards the river medway . <eos>   the chamber of the monument measures 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 13 feet ) in length , and 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 5 feet 6 inches ) in width , although it was potentially much larger when originally constructed . the chamber \\'s internal height would have been at least 2 metres ( 6 feet 6 inches ) . in its current state , the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs , one being 8 feet long , 7 feet , 6 inches deep , and 1 foot , 9 inches thick , and the other 5 feet long , 6 feet deep , and 2 feet thick . conversely , the chamber \\'s southern side consists of a single slab , measuring 11 feet , 4 inches in length , 7 feet , 3 inches in depth , and 1 foot , 9 inches in depth at its thicker , eastern end . the western end of the chamber is closed off with a slab measuring about 14 feet , 6 inches wide , with a thickness of 1 foot and a depth of around 8 feet . a collapsed , broken slab lies at the opening eastern end of the chamber . it is also possible that a largely rectangular slab at the bottom of the slope had once been part of the eastern end of the chamber . excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens ; twentieth @-@ century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement , allowing the stones to continue standing upright . <eos>   it is possible that there was a facade in front of the chamber , as is evident at other chambered tombs in britain , such as west kennet long barrow and < unk > \\'s smithy . it is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber , as was apparent at kit \\'s coty house and lower kit \\'s coty house . many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal . <eos>   the earthen mound that once covered the tomb is now visible only as an < unk > approximately 1 foot , 6 inches in height . in the nineteenth @-@ century , the mound was higher on the western end of the tomb , although this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath during the 1920s . it is likely that in the early neolithic , the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it , and it is inside this ditch that the kerb @-@ stones now sit . <eos>   the kerb @-@ stones around the tomb display some < unk > ; those on the northern side are mostly rectilinear , while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape . it is probable that there was an ancillary dry @-@ stone wall constructed using blocks of < unk > from the geological < unk > beds , as is evident at chestnuts long barrow . given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally , it may have been < unk > . <eos>   a < unk > line of < unk > and < unk > can be found on both one of the central kerb @-@ stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb @-@ stone on the south @-@ east of the monument . these have been attributed to the < unk > of flint and other stone axe @-@ < unk > on these sarsens . it is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber < unk > and struts which would have been used in < unk > the stones and constructing the tomb . similar evidence for the < unk > of tools has been found at west kennet long barrow , as well as later prehistoric monuments such as stonehenge . <eos>   coldrum long barrow is comparatively isolated from the other medway megaliths ; in this it is unique , given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups . however , it is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby ; a razed , elongated earthen mound with an east @-@ west orientation is located in a hollow at the foot of the downs just under a quarter of a mile to the north of the coldrum stones . it may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried . several large sarsens to the south of the < unk > might represent the remnants of a further such tomb , since destroyed . <eos>   <eos>   = = human remains = = <eos>   <eos>   <eos>   = = = demographics = = = <eos>   <eos>   ashbee suggested that given its size and comparisons with other long barrows , such as < unk > \\'s lodge , the coldrum tomb could have housed the remains of over a hundred individuals . excavations conducted in the early 20th century have led to the methodical discovery and removal of what was believed to be the remains of twenty @-@ two human individuals . these remains were examined by sir arthur keith , the < unk > of the museum at the royal college of surgeons . he published his results in 1913 , in a paper largely concerned with discerning racial characteristics of the bodies . <eos>   a subsequent re @-@ analysis of the bones was conducted in the early 21st century , and published in the proceedings of the prehistoric society in 2013 : the project presented \" < unk > analysis , bayesian modelling of < unk > dates , and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to inform on the < unk > , burial practices , diet and subsistence , and chronology of the coldrum population \" . < unk > earlier conclusions , it stated that the minimum number of individuals was seventeen . these were then further identified as probably belonging to nine adults ( probably five males and four females ) , two sub @-@ adults , four older children , and two younger children ( one around five years old , the other between 24 and 30 months old ) . <eos>   keith had suggested that the < unk > he examined displayed similar features , which he attributed to the different individuals belonging to \" one family - or several families united by common descent . \" similar observations had been made regarding the < unk > from other long barrows in britain , although < unk > martin smith and megan < unk > noted that this was not necessarily representative of a family group . instead , they stated that it would also be consistent with \" a population that was still relatively small and scattered \" , in which most individuals were interrelated . <eos>   < unk > \\'s team noted that in all but one case , the fracture morphologies are consistent with dry @-@ bone breakage . three of the skulls exhibited evidence that they had experienced violence ; a probable adult female had an < unk > injury on the left frontal , while an adult of indeterminate sex had an < unk > fracture on the left frontal , and a second adult female had a < unk > depressed fracture on the right frontal . <eos>   < unk > analysis of the remains revealed < unk > values that were typical of those found at many other southern british neolithic sites , albeit with significantly higher values of < unk > , which grew over time . although this data is difficult to interpret , it was identified as probably reflecting a terrestrial diet high in animal protein that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods . in the case of the older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb , the tooth enamel was worn away and the < unk > had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns . <eos>   < unk > dating of the remains suggested early neolithic activity began at the site during < unk > – < unk > < unk > bce ( 95 % probability ) or < unk > – < unk > cal bce ( 68 % probability ) , when the first human remains were buried at the site . it then suggested that after an interval of either 60 – 350 years ( 95 % probability ) or 140 – 290 years ( 68 % probability ) , further < unk > of human remains were made inside the tomb . this second phase probably began in < unk > – < unk > cal bce ( 95 % probability ) or < unk > – < unk > cal bce ( 68 % probability ) . the < unk > dating of the human remains does not provide a date for the construction of coldrum long barrow itself ; it is possible that the individuals died either some time before or after the monument \\'s construction . <eos>   <eos>   = = = post @-@ mortem deposition = = = <eos>   <eos>   cut @-@ marks were identified on a number of the bones ( two femora , two < unk > , and one < unk > ) , with < unk > specialists suggesting that these had been created post @-@ mortem as the bodies were < unk > and the bones removed from their attached ligaments . however , they further suggested that the lack of such cut @-@ marks on certain bones was < unk > that the body had already undergone partial decomposition or the removal of soft tissues prior to the process of dismemberment . the precision of the cut @-@ marks suggests that this dismemberment was done carefully ; \" they do not suggest frenzied hacking or mutilation . \" none of the criteria that < unk > deem diagnostic of cannibalism were found on the bones . <eos>   this cut @-@ marked human bone assemblage represented the largest yet identified from within a neolithic long barrow in southern britain , although similar evidence for dismemberment has been found from a number of other neolithic british sites , such as west < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , and < unk > . there are two possibilities for how this material developed . the first is that the bodies of the dead were < unk > or exposed to the elements , followed by a secondary burial within the tomb . the second is that they were placed in the tomb , where the flesh < unk > , before the bodies were then < unk > within the tomb itself . these practices may have been accompanied by < unk > , < unk > , or magical practices , direct evidence for which does not survive . <eos>   the inclusion of occupational debris over the bones was not unique to the site but common in chambered tombs from southern england . on the basis of an example discovered at kit \\'s coty house , ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the coldrum \\'s chamber would have been < unk > by < unk > slabs , which served the same purpose as the side chambers of west kennet and < unk > \\'s smithy . <eos>   <eos>   = = damage and < unk > = = <eos>   <eos>   all of the surviving megalithic tombs from the early neolithic period have suffered from neglect and the < unk > of agriculture . although archaeologist paul ashbee noted that the coldrum stones represent \" kent \\'s least damaged megalithic long barrow \" , it too has suffered considerable damage , having become dilapidated and fallen apart over the six millennia since its original construction . most prominently , the eastern side has largely collapsed , with the stones that once helped to hold up the side of the barrow having fallen to the bottom of the slope . conversely , it is possible that the sarsens at the bottom of the slope were not part of the original monument , but were stones found in nearby fields which were deposited there by farmers . <eos>   excavation of chestnuts long barrow revealed that it had been systematically destroyed in one event , and ashbee suggested that the same may have happened to the coldrum stones . he believed that the kerb @-@ stones around the barrow were toppled , laid prostrate in the surrounding ditch , and then buried during the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century , by christians seeking to < unk > non @-@ christian monuments . conversely , the archaeologist john alexander — who excavated chestnuts — suggested that the medway tombs were destroyed by robbers seeking to locate treasure within them . as evidence , he pointed to the close roll of 1237 , which ordered the opening of barrows on the isle of wight in search for treasure , a practice which may have spread to kent around the same time . alexander believed that the destruction n kent may have been brought about by a special commissioner , highlighting that the \" < unk > and < unk > of the robbery \" at chestnuts would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could likely produce . ashbee further suggested that in subsequent centuries , locals raided the damaged coldrum tomb for < unk > chalk and stone , which was then re @-@ used as building material . <eos>   <eos>   = = folklore and folk tradition = = <eos>   <eos>   in a 1946 paper published in the folklore journal , john h. evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the coldrum stones , and that a \" black prince \" was buried within its chamber . he suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other medway megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \" < unk > down from the theories of < unk > \" who believed that the early medieval battle of < unk > , which was recorded in the anglo @-@ saxon chronicle , took place in the area . <eos>   evans also recorded that there was a folk belief in the area that applied to all of the medway megaliths and which had been widespread \" up to the last generation \" ; this was that it was impossible for any human being to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments . this \" countless stones \" motif is not unique to this particular site , and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in britain . the earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early sixteenth @-@ century document , where it applies to the stone circle of stonehenge in wiltshire , although in an early seventeenth @-@ century document it was being applied to the < unk > , a set of three stone circles in cornwall . later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in england , as well as a single occurrence each in wales and ireland . the < unk > s. p. < unk > suggested that it could be attributed to an < unk > understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own . <eos>   in the early twenty @-@ first century , a tradition developed in which the hartley morris men , a < unk > dancing side , travel to the site at dawn every may day in order to \" sing up the sun \" . this consists of a number of dances performed within the stones on top of the barrow , followed by a song performed at the base of the monument . <eos>   <eos>   = = < unk > and archaeological investigation = = <eos>   <eos>   <eos>   = = = early antiquarian descriptions = = = <eos>   <eos>   the earliest antiquarian accounts of coldrum long barrow were never published . there are claims that at the start of the nineteenth century , the reverend mark noble , rector of < unk > , prepared a plan of the site for gentleman \\'s magazine , although no copies have been produced to verify this . between 1842 and 1844 , the reverend < unk > post authored < unk > remains at coldrum , in which he described the monument , although it remained unpublished at the time . < unk > the site with the < unk > of britain \\'s iron age , post \\'s suggestion was that the name \" coldrum \" derived from the linguistically celtic \" < unk > @-@ dun \" , and that the chiefs of some of the < unk > gauls were interned there . he further reported that in both 1804 and 1825 , skulls had been found at the site . in 1844 , an antiquarian named thomas wright published a note on the coldrum stones and other medway megaliths in the archaeological journal . wright had been alerted to their existence by a local vicar , the reverend lambert b. < unk > , and proceeded to visit them with him . describing the < unk > , wright mentioned \" a smaller circle of stones \" to the others in the area , with \" a subterranean < unk > in the middle \" . he further added that \" it is a tradition of the < unk > that a continuous line of stones ran from coldrum direct to the well @-@ known monument called kit \\'s < unk > [ sic ] house \" , attributing this belief to the variety of megaliths which were scattered throughout the landscape . <eos>   in 1857 , the antiquarian j. m. < unk > excavated at the site with the help of the reverend < unk > , providing a report of their findings to the central committee of the british archaeological association . describing the monument as a stone circle , they asserted that they discovered anglo @-@ saxon pottery at the site , and noted that as well as being called the coldrum stones , the monument also had the name of the < unk > stones , which < unk > believed originated with the old english word for funeral pile , ad . in august 1863 , the archaeological institute , who were then holding their week @-@ long meeting in rochester , took a tour to visit the site , guided by the < unk > charles < unk > smith . that year , the monument was described in a copy of gentleman \\'s magazine by yorkshire < unk > charles moore < unk > , who believed it to be a \" celtic \" stone circle . <eos>   in 1869 , the antiquarian a. l. lewis first visited the site , and was informed by locals that several years previously a skull had been uncovered from inside or near to the chamber , but that they believed it to be that of a < unk > . a later account elaborated on this , stating that two individuals excavated in the centre of the dolmen without permission , discovering a human skeleton , the skull of which was then re @-@ buried in the churchyard at < unk > . in an 1878 note published in the journal of the < unk > institute of great britain and ireland , lewis noted that while many tourists visited kit \\'s coty house , \" very few goes to or ever hears of a yet more curious collection of stones at < unk > or coldrum lodge \" . he believed that the monument consisted of both a \" chamber \" and an \" oval \" of stones , suggesting that they were \" two distinct < unk > \" . in 1880 , the archaeologist flinders petrie included the existence of the stones at \" < unk > \" in his list of < unk > earthworks ; although noting that a previous commentator had described the stones as being in the shape of an oval , he instead described them as forming \" a rectilinear enclosure \" around the chamber . he then included a small , basic plan of the monument . <eos>   in august 1889 , two amateur archaeologists , george payne and a. a. arnold , came across the monument , which they noted was known among locals as the \" coldrum stones \" and \" < unk > temple \" ; according to payne , \" the huge stones were so overgrown with < unk > and < unk > that they could not be discerned \" . he returned the next year , noting that at this point , the < unk > had been cut away to reveal the megaliths . in his 1893 book < unk > < unk > , payne noted that although it had first been described in print in 1844 , \" since that time no one seems to have taken the trouble to properly record them or make a plan \" , an unusual claim given that a copy of petrie \\'s published plan existed in his library . for this reason , after gaining permission from the landowner , he convinced major a. o. green , < unk > in survey at < unk > , to conduct a survey of the monument in august 1892 . he also wrote to the archaeologist augustus pitt @-@ rivers , encouraging him to schedule the coldrum stones as a legally protected site under the ancient monuments protection act 1882 . payne described the coldrum stones as \" the finest monument of its class in the county , and one worthy of every care and attention . \" comparing it to other monuments of its type in britain , he asserted that it was undoubtedly \" of sepulchral origin , belonging to a period anterior to the roman domination of britain . \" payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting coldrum to the addington long barrow , although added that he was unable to discover any evidence for the existence of this feature . <eos>   in 1904 , george clinch published a note on the medway megaliths in the royal < unk > institute \\'s journal , man , in which he referred to the coldrum stones as \" at once the most remarkable and the least known of the whole series . \" suggesting that its design indicates that it was built during \" a late date in the < unk > age \" , he compared the workmanship in producing the megaliths to that at the stone circle of stonehenge in wiltshire , although noted that they differed in that the coldrum stones clearly represented \" a sepulchral pile \" . ultimately , he ended his note by urging for the site to be protected under the ancient monuments protection act 1900 . in that same issue , lewis included an added note in which he rejected the idea that the monument had once been covered by an earthen tumulus because he could see \" no evidence that anything of that kind ever existed \" , and instead he interpreted the site as a stone circle , comparing it to the examples at < unk > , < unk

discovered human bones \" under only a few inches of < unk > soil \" . he returned to the site for further excavation in august 1910 , this time with his niece and her husband , both of whom were dentists with an interest in < unk > ; on that day they discovered pieces of a human skull , which they were able to largely reconstruct . a few days later he returned to excavate on the north @-@ west corner of the dolmen with the architect e. w. filkins ; that day , they found a second skull , further bones , a flint tool , and pieces of pottery . <eos>   later that month , george payne and f. w. reader met with bennett to discuss his finds . with the aid of two other interested amateur archaeologists , mr boyd and miss < unk > , both from < unk > , excavation resumed in early september . in 2009 , the archaeologists martin smith and megan < unk > asserted that bennett \\'s excavations had taken heed of the advice of pitt @-@ rivers that excavations should be recorded in full . they noted that bennett had provided \" clear plan and section drawings , photographs of the monument and careful attempts to consider site formation processes . \" suggesting that the monument was constructed on agricultural land , in his published report bennett cited the ideas of anthropologist james < unk > in the golden < unk > to suggest that the coldrum stones \" monument may at one time have been dedicated , though not necessarily initially so , to the worship of the corn god and of agriculture . \" he proceeded to < unk > that the human remains found at the site were the victims of human sacrifice killed in fertility rites . however , evans later stated that \" we have no means of knowing \" whether human sacrifice had taken place at the site . <eos>   in september 1922 , filkins once again began excavating at the site , this time with the aid of a resident of < unk > , charles gilbert . their project was financed through grants provided by the british association and the society of antiquaries , with filkins noting that at the time of its commencement , \" a miniature jungle \" had grown up around the site which had to be cleared . excavation continued sporadically until at least 1926 . human remains were discovered , and placed into the possession of sir arthur keith of the royal college of surgeons . this excavation revealed all the existing sarsens surrounding the monument , a number of which had previously been buried beneath earth . the stones of the dolmen were < unk > up with concrete foundations where filkins deemed it necessary . although filkins \\' excavation was comprehensive , it did ignore stone holes , packing stones , and their relationship to the mound . in 1998 , ashbee noted that while from \" a present @-@ day

plaque was erected to mark this , which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle ; in 1953 , the archaeologist leslie < unk > expressed the view that \" it is hoped that this error may be

rhode island general assembly passed a $ 12 million ( equivalent to $ 118 million in 2016 ) bond issue to fund the construction of a 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) , four @-@ lane divided arterial bypass of u.s. route 1 in wickford . construction on the highway began in 1952 and was completed in 1954 , at which time the roadway opened as an unnumbered state highway leading from us 1 to routes 2 and 102 in wickford . <eos>   during the late 1950s , a few years after the completion of the arterial , the rhode island department of public works ( < unk > ) proposed a relocation of route 2 , which , at the time , was the major thoroughfare in the area . no action was taken until 1964 , when the < unk > introduced a study for the \" < unk > route 2 \" proposal . during the study , drivers who used the colonel rodman highway arterial and were bound for the state capital of providence were < unk > onto route 2 , an accident @-@ prone , four @-@ lane undivided highway near the modern exit 5 . in 1965 , the planned route 2 freeway was given the new number of route 4 , leaving route 2 on its existing alignment . a public hearing was held by the state of rhode island on the proposed freeway , which was to be four lanes and have a divided , grassy median . this proposal was later accepted , and construction began two years later . <eos>   construction of a 5 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 7 km ) long section of route 4 from what is now exit 6 in east greenwich to i @-@ 95 in warwick began in 1967 and was completed in 1972 . that year , the 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) arterial south of the modern exit 5 was also designated as part of route 4 . the divided highway remains largely intact to this date as the stretch of route 4 from us 1 to routes 2 and 102 at exit 5 ; the only piece of the arterial that has been significantly altered is the construction of a bridge over amtrak \\'s northeast corridor line . by the early 1970s , route 4 was complete north of exit 6 and south of what would become exit 5 , but there was a still a missing piece in the highway between the two exits . in the 1970s , the state of rhode island faced several budget problems and environmental concerns , both of which delayed the construction of the missing link for nearly eleven years . environmental studies on the missing link began in 1977 , and the state estimated that the 1 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) long section of freeway would cost $ 15 – 21 million ( equivalent to $ 59 – 82 million in 2016 ) to construct . <eos>   in 1983 , the rhode island department of transportation ( ridot ) began construction of the new segment of route 4 between exits 5 and 6 . the project , which ultimately went over budget at $ 24 million ( equivalent to $ 52 million in 2016 ) ) , was financed from a $ 63 million federal grant . in 1986 , during excavation for the new right @-@ of @-@ way , the department of transportation found archeological items from the narragansett indians dating from about 2 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 500 years prior . although the findings were not centralized in the area , this caused delays for the extension of the freeway . on august 6 , 1988 , < unk > completed construction and performed a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony for the new highway . <eos>   in january 1990 , two police cruisers were severely damaged during a chase on route 4 . a driver was < unk > in the southbound lanes of route 4 near exit 7 ; when the driver exited at route 402 ( frenchtown road ) , two police officers got into serious accidents in their attempts to pursue the vehicle . after the crashes , the american civil liberties union < unk > efforts to amend police chase policy and avoid further crash @-@ related injuries for officers in the line of duty . <eos>   in 2000 , construction began on the quonset freeway , a relocated route 403 that serves the quonset business park from route 4 . the project included the reconstruction and reworking of exit 7 off route 4 , which was a southbound @-@ only exit serving both route 403 and route 402 when constructed . the exit was converted into a trumpet interchange with new ramps between route 4 , route 403 and route 402 and was completed in december 2008 , one year ahead of schedule . the project included the construction of a new northbound exit 7 serving route 403 east . <eos>   <eos>   = = future = = <eos>   <eos>   the rhode island department of transportation ( ridot ) has laid out long @-@ term plans for improvements to both the southern and northern < unk > of route 4 . during the 1980s and 1990s , ridot announced plans to eliminate the three traffic lights along the southern end of the highway . the department planned to replace the existing < unk > us 1 and route 4 merge , converting it into a grade @-@ separated interchange with an extensive overpass . this would cut @-@ off access to three local roads that intersect us 1 near the signal . the plan also included the replacement of the two other signaled intersections at west allenton road and oak hill road with overpasses ; the overpass for west allenton road is planned to be constructed as a new exit 4 . in the 1990s , the state purchased and demolished several houses in the region to allow for an expanded route 4 right @-@ of @-@ way in the vicinity of west allenton road . <eos>   the upgrade proposal proved to be very unpopular with north kingstown residents who lived on the affected local roads . additionally , ridot laid the highway out so that route 4 would cross through wetlands in the area . this sparked environmental concerns , as one of the large wetlands that would be affected , < unk > \\'s marsh , was deemed to be of high value by rhode island environmentalists . despite local and environmental concerns , ridot still considers the route 4 upgrade to be the < unk > way to improve traffic flow in the region . while the department of transportation considered upgrading nearby route 2 to freeway standards as a potential alternative , this plan was ultimately rejected because of its effects on wells in the area . although the project was originally scheduled to be completed by 2007 , the $ 55 million project has been postponed indefinitely . <eos>   ridot also has long @-@ range plans to construct direct freeway connections linking route 4 north with i @-@ 95 south and i @-@ 95 north with route 4

of constantly being asked for her primary genre , she felt that recording a christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres . she remarked , \" i always get asked what genre i \\' m in : \\' is this country or pop or rock ? what are you ? \\' and what \\'s cool about making the christmas album was , \\' oh , there are no limitations ! we can do whatever we want ! \\' \" . she further added , \" the thing about christmas is that it almost doesn \\' t matter what mood you \\'re in or what kind of a year you \\' ve had — it \\'s a fresh start . i \\' m going to

styles to create fresh , contemporary sound to classic @-@ sounding music . he recalled , \" it was a lot of fun for us because we got to go back to our roots . when kelly started singing , it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything . \" further adding , \" we really experimented . it was so much fun and liberating . and it pays off . \" kurstin , who studied with jazz

on the record to < unk > a memphis soul sound . he also collaborated with joseph < unk > to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra . <eos>   in providing instrumentation for the record , kurstin used all of his instruments such as a < unk > and a < unk > , taping them from a distance to stimulate the wall of sound , a recording technique originally developed by phil spector that was popular in the early 1960s . he enlisted clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself . clarkson , who grew up singing in a chorus , was pleased with the aspect ; saying , \" < unk > is something i knew how to do from childhood . sometimes i \\'d have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound . but i \\' ve never had to do anything like this before — doing all my backup vocals , essentially being my own choir . \" together , they began to record in may 2013 and continued through the summer of that year , beginning by recording \" white christmas \" with clarkson in the

where is it going to fit ? \\' you < unk > to whatever the song calls for . and that \\'s exactly what i did — without having to have an umbrella for everything . \" <eos>   in gathering inspirations

1994 ) and merry christmas to you ( 1997 ) by < unk > mcentire . while kurstin , who used to play in a jazz band , took influences from a charlie brown christmas by the vince < unk > trio and a

developed from an area of low pressure in the southeast gulf of mexico near the florida keys , and moved across the state of florida . as it entered the warm waters of the gulf stream in the atlantic ocean , it began to rapidly intensify , exhibiting traits of a tropical system , including the formation of an eye . it attained a pressure of 970 millibars on december 23 and 24 , and after moving northward , it came ashore near new york city on christmas eve . because of the uncertain nature of the storm , the national hurricane center ( nhc ) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone . <eos>   heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in south carolina . much of the rest of the east coast was affected by high winds , coastal flooding , and beach erosion . new

  the storm originated in an upper @-@ level low pressure system that moved southeastward from the central great plains into the deep south of the united states . after reaching the southeast gulf of

noted that \" as it moved out into the bahamas , it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm . \" the uncertain nature of the storm prevented the nhc from issuing advisories on it , and forecasters lacked sufficient data to fully assess the cyclone for potential tropical characteristics . the same trough that pushed the storm across florida had moved to the north , allowing for high pressure to develop in the upper levels of the atmosphere . <eos>   < unk > a \" hybrid storm \" , the cyclone rapidly intensified in warm waters of up to 80 ° f ( 27 ° c ) from the gulf stream combined with a cold air mass over the united states . the system continued to rapidly intensify while moving within the gulf stream ; it developed central convection , an unusual trait for an extratropical cyclone , and at one point exhibited an eye . despite these indications of tropical characteristics , \" there was no front associated with it and it had a warm core , but the radius of maximum winds was more than 150 nautical miles ( 170 mi ; 280 km ) , so under the standard nhc criteria it didn \\' t qualify as a tropical storm . \" on december 23 and 24 , the nor \\' easter intensified to attain a barometric pressure of 970 mb ( 29 inhg ) . an upper @-@ level low pressure system that developed behind the storm began to intensify and grew to be larger in size than the original disturbance . in an interaction known as the < unk > effect , the broad circulation of the secondary low swung the primary nor \\' easter northwestward towards southern new york and new england . the original low passed along the south shore of long island , and made landfall near new york city on december 24 . subsequently , it moved over southeastern new york state . on december 25

had earlier rejected the idea . ramesh sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it . the original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex @-@ soldiers to avenge the murder of his family . the army officer was later changed to a policeman because sippy felt that it would be difficult to get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities . salim @-@ javed completed the script in one month , incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances . <eos>   the film was loosely styled after akira < unk > \\'s 1954 film seven < unk > , and drew heavily from the conventions of westerns , especially sergio leone \\'s < unk > westerns such as once upon a time in the west ( 1968 ) , and john < unk > \\' film the magnificent seven ( 1960 ) . sholay was also influenced by the < unk > of sam peckinpah , such as the wild < unk > ( 1969 ) and pat garrett and billy the kid ( 1973 ) ; and by george roy hill \\'s butch < unk > and the sundance kid ( 1969 ) . a scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in north west frontier ( 1959 ) , and a scene showing the massacre of thakur \\'s family has been compared with the massacre of the < unk > family in once upon a time in the west . some plot elements were borrowed from the indian films mera < unk > mera < unk > ( 1971 ) and < unk > < unk > ( 1973 ) . <eos>   the character gabbar singh was modelled on a real @-@ life dacoit of the same name who had < unk > the villages around < unk > in the 1950s . any policeman captured by the real gabbar singh had his ears and nose cut off , and was released as a warning to other policemen . the character was also influenced by the villain \" el < unk > \" ( played by gian maria < unk > ) of sergio leone \\'s for a few < unk > more ( 1965 ) . soorma bhopali , a minor comic relief character , was based on an acquaintance of actor jagdeep , a forest officer from < unk > named soorma . the real @-@

, which told of the exploits of < unk > dacoits . the book was written by < unk > kumar bhaduri , the father of fellow cast member jaya bhaduri . as cast members had read the script ahead of time , many were interested in playing different parts . < unk > was considered for the role of thakur baldev singh , but sippy thought sanjeev kumar was a better choice . initially , dharmendra was also interested to play the role of thakur . he eventually gave up the role when sippy informed him that sanjeev kumar would play veeru if that happened , and would be paired with hema malini , who dharmendra was trying to woo . dharmendra knew that kumar was also interested in malini . sippy wanted < unk > < unk > to play the part of jai , but there were already several big stars signed , and amitabh bachchan , who was not extremely popular yet , lobbied hard to get the part for himself . <eos>   during the film \\'s production , four of the leads became romantically involved . bachchan married bhaduri four months before filming started . this led to shooting delays when bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter < unk > . by the time of the film \\'s release , she was pregnant with their son < unk > . dharmendra had begun wooing malini during their earlier film < unk > < unk > < unk > ( 1972 ) , and used the location shoot of sholay to further pursue her . during their romantic scenes , dharmendra would often pay the light boys to < unk > the shot , thereby ensuring many < unk > and allowing him to spend more time with her . the couple married five years after the film \\'s release . <eos>   <eos>   = = = filming = = = <eos>   <eos>   much of sholay was shot in the rocky terrain of ramanagara , a town near bangalore , karnataka . the filmmakers had to build a road from the bangalore highway to ramanagara for convenient access to the sets . art director ram < unk > had an entire township built on the site . a prison set was constructed near < unk > studio in mumbai , also outdoors , to match the natural lighting of the on @-@ location sets . one part of ramanagara was for a time called \" sippy nagar \" as a tribute to the director of the film . as of 2010 , a visit to the \" sholay rocks \" ( where much the film was shot ) was still being offered to tourists travelling through ramanagara . <eos>   filming began on location on 3 october 1973 , with a scene featuring bachchan and bhaduri . the film had a lavish production for its time ( with frequent banquets and parties for the cast ) , took two and a half years to make , and went over budget . one reason for its high cost was that sippy re @-@ filmed scenes many times to get his desired effect . \" yeh dosti \" , a 5 @-@ minute song sequence , took 21 days to shoot , two short scenes in which radha lights lamps took 20 days to film because of lighting problems , and the shooting of the scene in which gabbar kills the imam \\'s son lasted 19 days . the train robbery sequence , shot on the mumbai – pune railway route near < unk > , took more than 7 weeks to complete . <eos>   sholay was the first indian film to have a < unk > soundtrack and to use the 70 mm widescreen format . however , since actual 70 mm cameras were expensive at the time , the film was shot on traditional 35 mm film and the 4 : 3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2 @.@ 2 : 1 frame . regarding the process , sippy said , \" a < unk > [ sic ] format takes the < unk > of the big screen and < unk > it even more to make the picture even bigger , but since i also wanted a spread of sound we used six @-@ track < unk > sound and combined it with the big screen . it was definitely a < unk > . \" the use of 70 mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the < unk > logo . film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before ; one of them added the tagline : \" the greatest star cast ever assembled – the greatest story ever told \" . <eos>   <eos>   = = = < unk > version = = = <eos>   <eos>   the director \\'s original cut of sholay has a different ending in which thakur kills gabbar , along with some additional violent scenes . gabbar \\'s death scene , and the scene in which the imam \\'s son is killed , were cut from the film by india \\'s censor board , as was the scene in which thakur \\'s family is massacred . the censor board was concerned about the violence , and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely . although sippy fought to keep the scenes , eventually he had to re @-@ shoot the ending of the film , and as directed by the censor board , have the police arrive just before thakur can kill gabbar . the censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years . the original , < unk > cut of the film finally came out in a british release on vhs in 1990 . since then , < unk > international has released two versions on dvd . the director \\'s cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204 minutes in length ; the censored widescreen version is 198 minutes long . <eos>   <eos>   = = themes = = <eos>   <eos>   scholars have noted several themes in the film , such as glorification of violence , conformation to feudal ethos , debate between social order and mobilised usurpers , homosocial bonding , and the film \\'s role as a national allegory . <eos>   < unk > banerjea , a sociologist in the london school of economics , notes that sholay exhibits a \" sympathetic construction of \\' rogue \\' < unk > \" exemplified by the likeable outlaws jai and veeru . banerjea argues during the film , the moral boundary between legality and < unk > gradually < unk > . film scholar < unk > dissanayake agrees that the film brought \" a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order \" to indian cinema . film scholar m. < unk > prasad states that jai and veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society . prasad says that , through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of jai and veeru \\'s < unk > for the greater good , the narrative reflects reactionary politics , and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order . banerjea explains that though jai and veeru are mercenaries , they are < unk > by their emotional needs . such dualism makes them vulnerable , in contrast to the pure evil of gabbar singh . <eos>   gabbar singh , the film \\'s antagonist , was well received by the audience , despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty . dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character , and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions , a first for indian melodrama . he notes that the < unk > of violence in the film was < unk > and < unk > . he further notes that , unlike earlier < unk > in which the female body occupies the audience \\'s attention as an object of male < unk > , in sholay , the male body becomes the < unk > . it becomes the < unk > where good and evil compete for supremacy . dissanayake argues that sholay can be viewed as a national allegory : it lacks a < unk > logical narrative , it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged , and it shows the < unk > of human life resulting from a lack of emotions . taken together , these elements comprise the allegorical representation of india . the narrative style of sholay , with its violence , revenge , and < unk > action , is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in india at the time of its release . this tension culminated in the emergency ( rule by decree ) declared by prime minister indira gandhi in 1975 . <eos>   < unk > and < unk > note that , although the film borrowed heavily from the hollywood western genre , particularly in its visuals , it was successfully \" < unk > \" . as an example , william van der < unk > has compared a massacre scene in sholay with a similar scene in once upon a time in the west . although both films were similar in technical style , sholay emphasised indian family values and melodramatic tradition , while the western was more < unk > and restrained in its approach . < unk > rao , in encyclopedia of hindi cinema , notes that sholay < unk > the style of the western genre into a \" < unk > ethos \" . ted shen of the chicago reader notes sholay \\'s \" hysterical visual style \" and intermittent \" populist message \" . cultural critic and islamist scholar < unk > < unk > < unk > the film in his book the secret politics of our < unk > : innocence , < unk > and indian popular cinema , both for its caricature and stereotyping of muslim and women characters , and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers . < unk > notes that the two most prominent muslim characters in the film are soorma bhopali ( a < unk > criminal ) , and an < unk > victim of the bandits ( the imam ) . meanwhile , the sole function of one female character ( radha ) is to suffer her fate in silence , while the other female lead ( basanti ) is just a garrulous village < unk > . <eos>   some scholars have indicated that sholay contains homosocial themes . ted shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style . < unk > < unk > , in her book bollywood and < unk > : indian popular cinema , nation , and < unk > , states that the death of jai , and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads , is necessary for the sake of establishing a < unk > heterosexual relationship ( that of veeru and basanti ) . <eos>   <eos>   = = music = = <eos>   <eos>   r. d. burman composed the film \\'s music , and the lyrics were written by anand < unk > . the songs used in

, and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire < unk > as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop . while these stunts were performed , a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no < unk > was employed . <eos>   although never gaining wide fame , ali had a dedicated following on the vaudeville circuit in the united states . he performed for heads of state including tsar nicholas ii of russia . judy garland named him her favorite < unk > and david blaine identified ali as his favorite magician . < unk > of his act were captured in the short film strange as it seems ( 1930 ) and in politiquerias ( 1931 ) , the spanish @-@ language version of laurel and hardy \\'s < unk > come home . two documentaries contain footage of ali taken from politiquerias : 1977 \\'s < unk > ! , and 1999 \\'s vaudeville . ali \\'s unusual < unk > abilities led to rumors that the rockefeller institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post @-@ mortem . after he died in england , his body was offered to johns hopkins university for study , though the offer was declined . <eos>   <eos>   = = background = = <eos>   <eos>   hadji ali was born into a working @-@ class family in approximately 1887 or 1892 , depending on the source consulted , probably in egypt . his fame was as a < unk > of a recognized vaudeville subgenre known as a \" regurgitation act \" , involving the swallowing of material or objects and their regurgitation in various ways . ali became aware as a child that he possessed an unusual < unk > ability . he explained in response to audience questions at a performance held at st. mary \\'s hospital in niagara falls , new york , in may 1926 , that while swimming in the nile as a ten @-@ year @-@ old boy , he naturally discovered that he could swallow a large amount of water and blow it out like a whale spouting . he continued to develop and refine the ability as he grew older . a more dramatic version of these events was provided by ali \\'s daughter , almina ali , in an interview in england after his death . she stated that his abilities were first learned through a single incident : while bathing in the nile , he inadvertently swallowed a fish and an ample volume of water . instead of dying , as those present thought he might , ali simply regurgitated the liquid and the fish without ill effect . <eos>   ali learned that his regurgitation talents had the potential to entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen : <eos>   i tried out my tricks first of all in the street , swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain from one side of the road to the other ... a cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day , and chased me down the street . i thought he wanted to beat me up , but no — all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick . finally , he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers . <eos>   taking his abilities on the road , ali met an italian man in cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances . ali performed under contract throughout europe and at times for heads of state . according to ali , in or about 1914 he was summoned by tsar nicholas ii of russia to perform at the winter palace in saint petersburg , russia . he stated that the tsar \" must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration , which is now one of my most < unk > possessions . \" following world war i , ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world , learning more tricks as he went . <eos>   ali came to the united states with almina in the mid @-@ 1920s . they performed together at < unk > , carnivals and in vaudeville , sometimes advertised under the collective name , \" hadji ali & co . \" almina played the part of assistant in her father \\'s act , billed in his shows as \" the princess \" . ali alone had a variety of stage names , including : \" the great egyptian miracle man \" , \" the amazing < unk > \" , \" the egyptian < unk > \" , \" the human < unk > \" , \" the human < unk > \" and \" the 9th wonder of the scientific world \" . ali has been described as a \" large , barrel @-@ < unk > and bearded man ... [ that cut ] an imposing figure in his arab costume . \" <eos>   although ali spoke a number of languages and became a naturalized u.s. citizen , it was reported that almina acted as his interpreter in the united states and other places , as he did not speak english and was illiterate . once he had gained some notoriety , ali took on as his manager hubert julian , a former colonel in the < unk > air force . although he developed a significant following , even being named judy garland \\'s favorite < unk > , ali \" remained more a < unk > curiosity than a true vaudeville < unk > \" according to at least one source . nevertheless , at the time of his death in 1937 , julian commented that ali had \" earned big money in america — $ 1 @,@ 000 a week sometimes . i was building him up here [ in europe ] and had a continental tour arranged . \" <eos>   <eos>   = = performance = = <eos>   <eos>   the mainstay of ali \\'s act was \" water spouting \" . after swallowing large amounts of water , 60 to 100 glasses at a time , he < unk > the water in a continuous stream for a sustained period of time , sometimes approaching one minute . another common trick was to swallow 30 to 50 < unk > < unk > ( although one of his posters advertised 40 < unk > ) , followed by another nut of a different variety , such as an < unk > . ali then brought them up one by one with the odd @-@ nut @-@ out produced at a mark called out by the audience . in another trick , ali swallowed three to six < unk > of different < unk > and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members . <eos>   in a 1929 article appearing in the lowell sun newspaper , physician morris < unk > speculated that for ali \\'s nut feat , the one nut of a different variety was held in the mouth rather than swallowed , thus allowing him to produce it on cue . dr. < unk > also stated that unnamed \" investigators \" were convinced that for ali \\'s handkerchief stunt , to produce them in the sequence stipulated by the audience ali flavored the cloth , and could therefore taste for the correct one as he brought them up . ali also swallowed live < unk > , watches , coins , costume jewelry , paper money , peach pits , stones , live mice , buttons , pool balls and other odd objects . in another standard performance segment , he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of < unk > , he swallowed the smoke and , after a significant time had passed , issued it forth in a steady stream like an < unk > volcano . <eos>   ali \\'s longstanding finale was the swallowing of copious amounts of water again , but this time followed by a pint of kerosene . a prop was then produced , typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table , within which a small flame burned . < unk > than water and < unk > with it , the kerosene floated above the liquid in ali \\'s gut , allowing him to < unk > it first . the stage thus set , and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells , ali became a \" human flamethrower \" , < unk > the < unk > in a long stream over the sacrificial prop , setting it < unk > . once the kerosene was exhausted , the water followed , streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away , < unk > the fire . <eos>   at some performances , a panel or \" jury \" from the audience was invited on stage to verify that no trick mechanism was being employed — that he was actually swallowing the items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation . sometimes ali would < unk > into the audience during his nut swallowing trick . his stomach exposed by his standard costume , he invited audience members to pat his stomach , allowing them to hear the nuts < unk > within . one newspaper reported that ali \\'s feats , essentially controlled vomiting , were performed in \" a manner without the least bit of < unk > or anything bordering on < unk > . \" not everyone felt the same : at least one of ali \\'s engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act \" was killing their supper shows \" . < unk > < unk > and magician harry < unk > remarked in his 1920 work miracle < unk > and their methods that water spouting was a \" performance that could not fail to disgust a modern audience . \" <eos>   the abilities of ali fascinated the public and medical authorities . as reported in a 1928 < unk > press article , at one of ali \\'s acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during the performance . they came away satisfied that he was actually < unk > and < unk > the material and objects as claimed , but remained \" < unk > over his extraordinary performance . \" according to an article appearing in the < unk > daily news , \" < unk > of three continents have puzzled over the < unk > mechanism of this human ostrich without success . x @-@ ray experiments have been made during his exhibition without a plausible explanation

royal navy patrols stopping and searching french ships sailing for the mysorean port of mangalore . when a french convoy from mahé passed the british port of tellicherry in november 1791 , commodore william cornwallis sent a small squadron to intercept the french ships . <eos>   as the british force under captain sir richard strachan approached the convoy , the escorting frigate résolue opened fire . a general action followed , with strachan succeeding in forcing the french ship to surrender within twenty minutes and both sides suffering damage and casualties . all of the french vessels

of the treaty of mangalore that had ended the second anglo @-@ mysore war , the ruler of mysore tipu sultan again declared war on the british east india company and their allies in southern india . for the next two years the war continued as british forces and their allies drove the mysore armies back towards the capital of < unk > . both sides were reliant on supply by sea to maintain their campaigns inland : the british forces were supported from their major ports at bombay and madras , later < unk > additional forces at the small port of tellicherry inside mysore territory . the mysorean forces were supplied through mangalore by french ships . france had been an ally of the tipu sultan \\'s father < unk > ali during the second anglo @-@ mysore war and although the political instability caused by the french revolution in europe prevented active involvement , they ensured that their ships kept up a supply of equipment to mysore throughout the war . <eos>   in an effort to eliminate french support commodore william cornwallis , the british naval commander in the region , stationed a squadron of frigates at tellicherry , where they were ideally situated to blockade mangalore and prevent the passage of shipping into mysorean territory . the squadron consisted of cornwallis in hms minerva , captain sir richard strachan in hms phoenix and hms < unk > under captain isaac smith . the french operated a squadron of their own on the coast , led by commodore saint @-@ félix and consisting of two frigates based at mahé , a small french port 7 miles ( 11 km ) south of tellicherry . the french had communicated to the british at tellicherry that they would not submit to any attempts to search their vessels , but strachan and cornwallis replied that they would enforce the blockade of mangalore whatever the consequences . <eos>   <eos>   = = battle = = <eos>   <eos>   in november 1791 , a french convoy sailed from mahé on the short journey to mangalore . the convoy

and < unk > to stop and inspect the french ships to ensure they were not carrying military supplies . as smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them , strachan did the same to résolue , < unk > the french captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate . the french captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality , and responded by opening fire : british sources suggest that his initial target was the small boat , although phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged . <eos>   strachan was < unk > at the french reaction , and returned fire immediately , the proximity of the ships preventing any manoeuvres . within twenty minutes the combat was decided , the french captain < unk > down his colours with his ship battered and more than 60 men wounded or dead . the french ship carried significantly weaker cannon than phoenix , with 6 and 12 pounder guns to the 9 and 18 pounders aboard the british squadron . in addition , résolue was heavily outnumbered : no other french warships were in the area while the british had three large frigates within sight . french losses eventually totalled 25 men killed and 60 wounded , strachan suffering just six killed and 11 wounded in return . <eos>   <eos>   = = aftermath = = <eos>   <eos>   with the enemy subdued , strachan ordered a thorough search of the captured vessels , but could

strachan for the wounded french sailors . soon afterwards saint @-@ félix arrived at mahé in his frigate < unk > and reacted furiously at the discovery that one of his neutral ships had been attacked and captured by the british . when cornwallis insisted that his ships had been acting within their orders , saint @-@ félix promised < unk > if any of his vessels were attacked again and withdrew with both < unk > and résolue later in the day , followed by minerva and phoenix . one account reported that saint @-@ félix actually ordered his crew to fire on cornwallis but that they refused . the british shadowed the french for several days , openly stopping and searching french merchant ships but without provoking a response from saint @-@ félix . résolue and phoenix were subsequently detached by their commanders , cornwallis and saint @-@ félix remaining in contact for several more days before finally separating . <eos>   news of the encounter was conveyed back to france , but the country was at this time in one of the most turbulent eras of the ongoing revolution and little notice was taken of events in india . historian william james notes that under normal political circumstances the action would have had more significant ramifications , while edward pelham brenton claims that the french deliberately ignored the report out of fear of < unk > britain . in britain , the admiralty approved of cornwallis \\' actions , suggesting that the french were deliberately using the guise of trade to support mysore against britain . the action had no effect on the ongoing war in india , which was now centred on the inland city of < unk > . as british forces closed on the city in february 1792 , the tipu sultan initiated peace talks which brought the war to an end in

unk > \" ) . the two would collaborate again on \" te busqué \" ( \" i searched for you \" ) , the single from furtado \\'s album loose . the album was < unk > from her label dreamworks records ; it was announced on 11 november 2003 that universal music group reached an agreement to acquire dreamworks records from dreamworks < unk > for \" about $ 100 million \" . the purchase came at a time when the music business was \" going through major changes \" as it struggled to \" counter falling sales and the impact of unofficial online music sales \" . dreamworks records was folded into the interscope geffen a & m umbrella label in january 2004 . furtado \\'s recording contract was then absorbed into geffen records . <eos>   <eos>   = = recording = = <eos>   <eos>   furtado began work on loose by holding with < unk > < unk > what she referred to as a \" hip @-@ hop workshop \" , in which they would \" write rhymes , < unk > them , and try different flows over beats . \" the first producers she worked with were track & field — who co @-@ produced her first two albums , < unk > , nelly ! ( 2000 ) and folklore ( 2003 ) — and by may 2005 , she had collaborated with < unk > members and k < unk > . she worked with < unk > hooper in london on reggae @-@ oriented material and with lester < unk > in los angeles on acoustic songs . one of the tracks < unk > helped to create is \" te busqué \" , which is co @-@ written by and features juanes , who collaborated with furtado on his 2002 song \" < unk > \" . during her time in los angeles , she worked with rick < unk > , who co @-@ wrote and produced \" in god \\'s hands \" and \" somebody to love \" . <eos>   in miami , florida , furtado collaborated with < unk > ( who introduced her to reggaeton and who gave her a \" shout @-@ out \" in his 2005 single \" can i have it like that \" ) and scott < unk > ( with whom she recorded a \" straight @-@ up rap song \" ) before entering the studio with timbaland . he and his protégé at the time , danja , co @-@ produced eight of the tracks , with another produced solely by danja . for some of the beats on the songs , timbaland finished work on ones already present in the studio that were half @-@ developed or just \" < unk > \" ; the rest were completely reworked . furtado recorded around forty tracks for loose , deciding which she would include based on the < unk > of the album — she called timbaland \" a sonic extraterrestrial \" who came up with a sequence of songs that flowed , and said that the one she had devised was supposedly unsatisfactory . she recorded an unreleased collaboration with justin timberlake , \" < unk > control \" , which she described as \" kind of sexy \" and \" a cute , < unk > , upbeat , fun track \" . other songs considered for inclusion on the album include \" < unk > boy \" , \" friend of mine \" , \" go \" , \" hands in the air \" , \" pretty boy \" , \" vice \" and \" < unk > \" . <eos>   furtado said in her diary on her official website that she recorded a remix of \" maneater \" with rapper lil wayne ; it was only released as part of a compilation album , timbaland \\'s remix & soundtrack collection , she also used the instrumental of the song during many television performances of \" maneater \" . a version of \" all good things ( come to an end ) \" featuring vocals by coldplay lead singer chris martin , who co @-@ wrote the song , was not released after a request from martin \\'s label , emi . the song was released on the album , but only furtado \\'s vocals are featured . furtado explained that \" loose was 90 percent written with a beat first , and then i ’ d write my melodies and songs to the beat . \" <eos>   <eos>   = = post @-@ production = = <eos>   <eos>   the \" off @-@ the @-@ cuff \" conclusion to production was one of the reasons the album was titled loose . it was named partly after the spontaneous decisions she made when creating the album . the album is also called loose because it is \" the opposite of calculated \" and came naturally to furtado and timbaland ; she called him her \" distant musical cousin because he was always pushing boundaries and always carving out his own path \" , which she believed she was doing with loose . \" i think you have to keep surprising people as an artist , and i like that — i love doing that \" , she said . loose was also named partly for the r & b girl group tlc , who furtado said she < unk > for \" taking back their sexuality , showing they were complete women . \" she said she wanted the album to be \" assertive and cool \" and \" sexy but fun \" , like tlc , mc < unk > , queen < unk > and janet jackson , who inspired furtado because , as she put it , she was \" comfortable in her sexuality and womanhood \" when her 1993 single \" that \\'s the way love goes \" was released . <eos>   during the recording of loose , furtado listened to several electro and rock musicians , including < unk > party , system of a down , m.i.a. , < unk > , queens of the stone age , < unk > and death from above 1979 , some of whom influenced the \" rock sound \" present on the album and the \" < unk > , laughing , distorted < unk > \" that were kept in the songs deliberately . according to her , music by such bands is \" very loud and has a garage theme \" to it , some of which she felt she captured on the album . furtado has said rock music is \" rhythmic again \" and hip hop @-@ influenced after it had become \" so churning and boring . \" because the mixing engineers were aware of timbaland and furtado \\'s rock influences , the songs were mixed on a mixing board in the studio instead of \" the fancy mixer at the end \" . furtado said she preferred the louder volume that process gave to the album because she wanted it to sound like her demo tapes , which she prefers to her finished albums . she said , \" it didn \\' t have that final wash over it ; it didn \\' t have the final pressing at the end , save for a couple sounds \" . <eos>   <eos>   = = music and lyrics = = <eos>   <eos>   furtado said that with the release of her albums before loose , she had wanted to prove herself as a musician and earn respect from listeners through using many different instruments on an album , which most hip hop musicians did not do . after she believed she had accomplished that , she felt she had freedom to make the type of music she \" really love [ d ] \" . furtado said her previous problem with hip hop was that she did not think it was good enough to base one of her albums on , but that she then asked herself why she was being \" pretentious \" . the album represents her separating from such notions and , in her words , \" jumping in the deep end of the pool — \\' < unk > , screw it , this is fun ! \\' \" . furtado said she considers herself \" all over the map \" and < unk > musically because she is not faithful to one style . <eos>   for the first time , furtado worked with a variety of record producers and followed a more collaborative approach in creating the album . produced primarily by timbaland and danja , loose showcases furtado experimenting with a more r & b – hip hop sound and , as she put it , the \" surreal , theatrical elements of \\' 80s music \" . she has categorized the album \\'s sound as punk @-@ hop , which she describes as < unk > @-@ influenced \" modern , poppy , < unk > music \" and stated that \" there \\'s a mysterious , after @-@ midnight vibe to [ it ] that \\'s extremely visceral \" . furtado has described the album as \" more urban , more american , more hip @-@ hop , [ and ] more simplified \" than her earlier work , which she said was more layered and textured because she \" tend [ s ] to < unk > things \" . in contrast , during her studio time with timbaland , she said she was \" in the < unk > boys club of just letting go \" and being more impulsive . according to furtado , instead of \" pristine stuff \" , the album features \" really raw \" elements such as distorted bass lines , laughter from studio outtakes and general \" room for error \" . furtado has said loose is not as much about the lyrics , which are not included in the liner notes , as it is about \" < unk > in pleasures — whether it \\'s dancing or < unk > . \" according to her , she wasn \\' t trying to be sexy with the album — \" i think i just am sexy now \" , she said . <eos>   <eos>   = = songs = = <eos>   <eos>   the opening track , \" < unk > \" ( featuring rapper < unk > ) , is a description of furtado \\'s fear of what people think of her , and she has said the chorus reminds her of \" walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in . now that i \\' m an adult , i care about the inside of me ... before i said i didn \\' t care about what people thought about me , but i really did . \" \" maneater \" is an uptempo electro rock song that combines 1980s electro synths and a more dance @-@ oriented beat . the up @-@ tempo song has prominent electropop and synthpop influences and is lyrically related to how people become \" hot on themselves \" when dancing in their < unk > in front of a mirror . \" promiscuous \" ( featuring timbaland ) was inspired by a flirting exchange furtado had with < unk > , who co @-@ wrote the song <eos>   she has characterised the fifth track , \" < unk > \" , as \" a proper r & b slow jam \" . \" no hay igual \" is a hip hop and reggaeton song , that has a < unk > tongue < unk > over \" future @-@ < unk > \" beats . the song contains a \" sharp mix \" of percussion and \" empowered chanting \" . in \" no hay igual \" , furtado sings in spanish and raps in portuguese over a reggaeton rhythm . the album also features more introspective songs , and the sunday times wrote that it \" has a surprising sadness to it . \" the seventh track , \" te busqué \" , which features latin singer juanes , is about furtado \\'s experiences with depression , which she said she has had periodically since she was around seventeen years old . furtado said she was unsure what \" say it right \" is about , but that it encapsulates her feeling when she wrote it and \" < unk > into this other sphere \" ; in an interview for the sunday times , it was mentioned that it is about her breakup with dj jasper < unk > , the father of her daughter . \" in god \\'s hands \" , another song on the album , was also inspired by the end of their relationship . <eos>   <eos>   = = singles = = <eos>   <eos>   in april 2006 , a remix of \" no hay igual \" featuring calle 13 was issued as a club single in the us . during the same period , \" promiscuous \" ( featuring timbaland ) was released for digital download in north america . promiscuous became furtado \\'s first single to top the us billboard hot 100 and was released in australia , where it reached the top five . the lead single in europe and latin america , \" maneater \" , was released in late may to early june 2006 . it became furtado \\'s first single to top the uk singles chart and made the top ten in other countries ;

furtado presented in promotion and publicity for the album , and in particular the music videos for \" promiscuous \" and \" maneater \" , in which she dances around with her < unk > exposed . according to maclean \\'s magazine , some said that furtado \\'s progression was a natural transformation of a pop singer ; others believed that she had \" sold out \" in an effort to garner record sales , particularly after her second album was a commercial failure in comparison to her first . maclean \\'s wrote that her makeover \" seems a bit forced \" and contrasted her with singers such as madonna and emily < unk > of < unk > : \" [ they ] seem to be completely in control , even somewhat intimidating in their sexuality : they \\' ve made a calculated decision for commercial and feminist reasons . in contrast , furtado \\'s new , overt sexuality comes off as unoriginal — < unk > by thousands of < unk > pop stars with a quarter of furtado \\'s natural talent ... the < unk > feels as if it \\'s been imposed rather than chosen by the unique , articulate singer we \\' ve seen in the past . \" <eos>   < unk > magazine wrote that furtado \\'s new \" highly < unk > \" image was manufactured , and noted the involvement in the album \\'s development of geffen \\'s jimmy < unk > , who helped to develop the pussycat dolls , a girl group known for their sexually < unk > dance routines . the writer also criticised furtado \\'s discussion of her buttocks and apparent rejection of < unk > in a blender magazine interview , writing : \" girls , do you hear that churning ? those are the ideas of gloria < unk > turning in their grave . \" a writer for the canadian broadcasting corporation said that < unk > could attribute furtado \\'s commercial success with loose to her \" <

musician < unk > \" tempest \" < unk > \\'s song \" < unk > evening \" , winner of the assembly 2000 < unk > music competition . timbaland used the record of < unk > adaptation of the song written by

<eos>   = antimony = <eos>   <eos>   antimony is a chemical element with symbol sb ( from latin : stibium ) and atomic number 51 . a lustrous gray metalloid , it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite ( sb2s3 ) . antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics ; metallic antimony was also known , but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery . in the west , it was first isolated by < unk > biringuccio and described in 1540 , although in primitive cultures its powder has been used to cure eye < unk > , as also for eye shadow , since time immemorial , and is often referred to by its arabic name , kohl . <eos>   for some time , china has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds , with most production coming from the < unk > mine in < unk > . the industrial methods to produce antimony are roasting and reduction using carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron . <eos>   the largest applications for metallic antimony are as < unk > material for lead and tin and for lead antimony plates in lead – acid batteries . < unk > lead and tin with antimony improves the properties of the

antimony is stable in air at room temperature , but reacts with oxygen if heated , to form antimony trioxide , < unk > . <eos>   antimony is a silvery , lustrous gray metalloid that has a < unk >

elemental antimony is a brittle , silver @-@ white < unk > metalloid . when slowly cooled , molten antimony < unk > in a trigonal cell , < unk > with the gray allotrope of arsenic . a rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony < unk > . when < unk > with a sharp implement , an < unk > reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony is formed ; when rubbed with a < unk > in a mortar , a strong detonation occurs . black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of vapor derived from metallic antimony . it has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic , it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously . at 100 ° c , it gradually transforms into the stable form . the yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable . it has only been generated by oxidation of stibine ( < unk > ) at − 90 ° c. above this temperature and in ambient light , this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope . <eos>   elemental antimony adopts a layered structure ( space group < unk > no . 166 ) in which layers consist of fused < unk > six @-@ membered rings . the nearest and next @-@ nearest neighbors form an irregular < unk > complex , with the three atoms in the same double layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next . this relatively close packing leads to a high density of 6 @.@ 697 g

recognized in predynastic egypt as an eye cosmetic ( kohl ) as early as about 3100 bc , when the cosmetic palette was invented . <eos>   an artifact , said to be part of a vase , made of antimony dating to about 3000 bc was found at < unk > , < unk > ( part of present @-@ day iraq ) , and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 bc and < unk > bc has been found in egypt . austen , at a lecture by herbert gladstone in 1892 commented that \" we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal , which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase , and therefore this remarkable \\' find \\' ( artifact mentioned above ) must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable . \" <eos>   < unk > was < unk > the artifact was indeed a vase , mentioning that < unk > , after his analysis of the < unk > object ( published in 1975 ) , \" attempted to relate the metal to < unk > natural antimony \" ( i.e. native metal ) and that \" the antimony objects from < unk > are all small personal ornaments . \" this weakens the evidence for a lost art \" of rendering antimony malleable . \" <eos>   the roman scholar pliny the elder described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise natural history . pliny the elder also made a distinction between \" male \" and \" female \" forms of antimony ; the male form is probably the sulfide , while the female form , which is superior , heavier , and less < unk > , has been suspected to be native metallic antimony . <eos>   the roman naturalist < unk > < unk > mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air . it is thought that this produced metallic antimony . <eos>   the first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book de la < unk > of 1540 by < unk > biringuccio ; this predates the more famous < unk > book by < unk > , de re < unk > . in this context < unk > has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony . the book < unk > < unk > < unk > ( the < unk > chariot of antimony ) , describing the preparation of metallic antimony , was published in germany in 1604 . it was purported to have been written by a benedictine monk , writing under the name < unk > < unk > , in the 15th century ; if it were authentic , which it is not , it would predate biringuccio . <eos>   the metal antimony was known to german chemist andreas < unk > in 1615 who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide , salt and potassium tartrate . this procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface . <eos>   with the advent of challenges to < unk > theory it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides , oxides , and other compounds , as is the case with other metals . <eos>   the first natural occurrence of pure antimony in the earth \\'s crust was described by the swedish scientist and local mine district engineer anton von < unk > in 1783 ; the type @-@ sample was collected from the < unk > silver mine in the < unk > mining district of < unk > , < unk > , sweden . <eos>   <eos>   = = = etymology = = = <eos>   <eos>   the ancient words for antimony mostly have , as their chief meaning , kohl , the sulfide of antimony . <eos>   the egyptians called antimony < unk > ; in hieroglyphs , the vowels are uncertain , but there is an arabic tradition that the word is < unk > < unk > . the greek word , < unk > stimmi , is probably a loan word from arabic or from egyptian < unk > <eos>   and is used by < unk > tragic poets of the 5th century bc ; later greeks also used < unk > < unk > , as did < unk > and pliny , writing in latin , in the first century ad . pliny also gives the names < unk > [ sic ] , < unk > , alabaster , and the \" very common \" < unk > , \" wide @-@ eye \" ( from the effect of the cosmetic ) . later latin authors adapted the word to latin as stibium . the arabic word for the substance , as opposed to the cosmetic , can appear as < unk > < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , or < unk > . < unk > suggests the first form , which is the earliest , derives from < unk > , an < unk > for stimmi . <eos>   the use of sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to < unk > jakob berzelius , who used this abbreviation of the name stibium . the medieval latin form , from which the modern languages and late byzantine greek take their names for antimony , is antimonium . the origin of this is uncertain ; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation . the popular etymology , from < unk > anti @-@ < unk > or french < unk > , still has adherents ; this would mean \" monk @-@ killer \" , and is explained by many early < unk > being monks , and antimony being poisonous . <eos>   another popular etymology is the hypothetical greek word < unk > < unk > , \" against < unk > \" , explained as \" not found as metal \" , or \" not found < unk > \" . < unk > conjectured a hypothetical greek word < unk > < unk > , which would mean \" < unk > \" , and cites several examples of related greek words ( but not that one ) which describe chemical or biological < unk > . <eos>   the early uses of antimonium include the translations , in < unk > – 1100 , by constantine the african of arabic medical < unk > . several authorities believe antimonium is a scribal corruption of some arabic form ; < unk > derives it from < unk > ; other possibilities include < unk > , the arabic name of the metalloid , and a hypothetical as @-@ stimmi , derived from or parallel to the greek . <eos>   <eos>   = = production = = <eos>   <eos>   <eos>   = = = top producers and production volumes = = = <eos>   <eos>   the

the current british economy and lifestyle . <eos>   also , antimony was identified as one of 12 critical raw materials for the eu in a report published in 2011 , primarily due to the lack of supply outside china . <eos>   < unk > production of antimony in china fell in 2010 and is unlikely to increase in the coming years , according to the roskill report . no significant antimony deposits in china have been developed for about ten years , and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted . <eos>   the world \\'s largest antimony producers , according to roskill , are listed

antimony is mined as the sulfide ; lower @-@ grade ores are concentrated by < unk > flotation , while higher @-@ grade ores are heated to 500 – 600 ° c , the temperature at which stibnite < unk > and is separated from the < unk > minerals . antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by a reduction with scrap iron : <eos>   sb <eos>   2s <eos>   3 + 3 fe → 2 sb + 3 < unk > <eos>   the sulfide is converted to an oxide and advantage is often taken of the < unk > of antimony ( iii ) oxide , which is recovered from roasting . this material is often used directly for the main applications , impurities being arsenic and sulfide . < unk > antimony from its oxide is performed by a < unk > reduction : <eos>   2 sb <eos>   2o <eos>   3 + 3 c → 4 sb + 3 co <eos>   2 <eos>   the

and oh radicals , thus inhibiting fire . < unk > for these flame @-@ < unk > applications include children \\'s clothing , toys , aircraft and automobile seat covers . it is also used in the

during charging . it is used in < unk > alloys ( such as < unk > metal ) , in bullets and lead shot , cable < unk > , type metal ( for example , for < unk > printing machines ) , < unk > ( some \"

three other applications make up nearly all the rest of the consumption . one of these uses is as a < unk > and a catalyst for the production of < unk > . another application is to serve as a fining agent to remove microscopic bubbles in glass , mostly for tv screens ; this is achieved by the interaction of antimony ions with oxygen , interfering the latter from forming bubbles . the third major application is the use as pigment . <eos>   antimony is being increasingly used in the < unk > industry as a < unk > for heavily doped n @-@ type silicon < unk > in the production of diodes , infrared

< unk > antimonide is used as a material for mid @-@ infrared detectors . <eos>   few biological or medical applications exist for antimony . < unk > principally containing antimony are known as < unk

<eos>   in the heads of some safety matches , antimony ( iii ) sulfide is used . antimony @-@ 124 is used together with beryllium in neutron sources ; the gamma rays emitted by antimony @-@ 124 initiate the < unk > of beryllium . the emitted neutrons have an average energy of 24 kev . antimony sulfides have been shown to help stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad

inhalation of antimony trioxide ( and similar poorly soluble sb ( iii ) dust particles such as antimony dust ) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer . however , these effects are only observed with female rats and after long @-@ term exposure to high dust concentrations . the effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance , lung < unk > , inflammation and ultimately < unk > formation , not to exposure to antimony ions ( < unk > , 2008 ) . antimony < unk > are corrosive to skin . the effects of antimony are not comparable to arsenic ; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake , metabolism and < unk > between arsenic and antimony . <eos>   for oral absorption , < unk > ( 1994 ) recommended values of 10 % for tartar emetic and 1 % for all other antimony compounds . < unk > absorption for metals is estimated at most 1 % ( < unk > , 2007 ) . inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble sb ( iii ) substances ( such as antimony dust ) is estimated at 6 @.@ 8 % ( < unk > , 2008 ) , whereas a value < 1 % is derived for sb ( v ) substances . antimony ( v ) is not < unk > reduced to antimony ( iii ) in the cell , and both species exist simultaneously . <eos>   antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine . antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects , with the exception of antimony potassium tartrate ( \" tartar emetic \" ) , a < unk > that is intentionally used to treat < unk > patients . <eos>   < unk > skin

1890 – 22 july 1976 ) was a british archaeologist and officer in the british army . over the course of his career , he served as director of both the national museum of wales and london museum , director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india , and the founder and honorary director of the institute of archaeology in london , further writing twenty @-@ four books on archaeological subjects . <eos>   born in glasgow to a middle @-@ class family , wheeler was raised largely in yorkshire before relocating to london in his teenage years . after studying classics at university college london ( ucl ) , he began working professionally in archaeology , specializing in the romano @-@ british period . during world war i he volunteered for service in the royal artillery , being stationed on the western front , where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the military cross . returning to britain , he obtained his doctorate from ucl before taking on a position at the national museum of wales , first as keeper of archaeology and then as director , during which time he oversaw excavation at the roman forts of segontium , y < unk > , and < unk > augusta with the aid of his first wife , tessa wheeler . < unk > by the archaeologist augustus pitt rivers , wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of < unk > context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach , developing the \" wheeler method \" . in 1926 , he was appointed keeper of the london museum ; there , he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection , successfully lobbied for increased funding , and began lecturing at ucl . <eos>   in 1934 , he established the institute of archaeology as part of the federal university of london , adopting the position of honorary director . in this period , he oversaw excavations of the roman sites at lydney park and verulamium and the iron age hill fort of maidan castle . during world war ii , he re @-@ joined the armed forces and rose to the rank of brigadier , serving in the north african campaign and then the allied invasion of italy . in 1944 he was appointed director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india , through which he oversaw excavations of sites at harappa , arikamedu , and < unk > , and implemented reforms to the subcontinent \\'s archaeological establishment . returning to britain in 1948 , he divided his time between lecturing for the institute of archaeology and acting as archaeological adviser to pakistan \\'s government . in later life , his popular books , cruise ship lectures , and appearances on radio and television , particularly the bbc series animal , < unk > , mineral ? , helped to bring archaeology to a mass audience . appointed honorary secretary of the british academy , he raised large sums of money for archaeological projects , and was appointed british representative for several unesco projects . <eos>   wheeler is recognised as one of the most important british archaeologists of the twentieth century , responsible for successfully encouraging british public interest in the discipline and advancing methodologies of excavation and recording . further , he is widely acclaimed as a major figure in the establishment of south asian archaeology . however , many of his specific interpretations of archaeological sites have been discredited or < unk > , and he was often criticised for bullying colleagues and sexually harassing young women . <eos>   <eos>   = = early life = = <eos>   <eos>   <eos>   = = = childhood : 1890 – 1907 = = = <eos>   <eos>   mortimer wheeler was born on 10 september 1890 in the city of glasgow , scotland . he was the first child of the journalist robert mortimer wheeler and his second wife emily wheeler ( née < unk > ) . the son of a tea merchant based in bristol , in youth robert had considered becoming a baptist minister , but instead became a staunch < unk > while studying at the university of edinburgh . initially working as a lecturer in english literature , robert turned to journalism after his first wife died in childbirth . his second wife , emily , shared her husband \\'s interest in english literature , and was the niece of thomas spencer < unk > , a shakespearean scholar at st. andrews university . their marriage was emotionally strained , a situation exacerbated by their financial insecurity . within two years of their son \\'s birth , the family moved to edinburgh , where a daughter named amy was born . the couple gave their two children nicknames , with mortimer being \" < unk > \" and amy being \" < unk > \" . <eos>   when wheeler was four , his father was appointed chief leader writer for the bradford observer . the family relocated to < unk > , a village northwest of bradford , a cosmopolitan city in yorkshire , northeast england , which was then in the midst of the wool trade boom . wheeler was inspired by the < unk > surrounding < unk > and fascinated by the area \\'s archaeology . he later wrote about discovering a late prehistoric cup @-@ marked stone , searching for < unk > on < unk > moor , and digging into a barrow on < unk > moor . although suffering from ill health , emily wheeler taught her two children with the help of a maid up to the age of seven or eight . mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother , instead being far closer to his father , whose company he favoured over that of other children . his father had a keen interest in natural history and a love of fishing and shooting , rural < unk > in which he encouraged mortimer to take part . robert acquired many books for his son , particularly on the subject of art history , with wheeler loving to both read and paint . <eos>   in 1899 , wheeler joined bradford grammar school shortly before his ninth birthday , where he proceeded straight to the second form . in 1902 robert and emily had a second daughter , whom they named betty ; mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister . in 1905 , robert agreed to take over as head of the london office of his newspaper , by then renamed the yorkshire daily observer , and so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in december , settling into a house named carlton lodge on south croydon road , west < unk > . in 1908 they moved to 14 < unk > avenue in nearby < unk > hill . rather than being sent for a conventional education , when he was 15 wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in london , where he frequented the national gallery and the victoria and albert museum . <eos>   <eos>   = = = university and early career : 1907 – 14 = = = <eos>   <eos>   after passing the entrance exam on his second attempt , in 1907 wheeler was awarded a scholarship to read classical studies at university college london ( ucl ) , < unk > daily from his parental home to the university campus in bloomsbury , central london . at ucl , he was taught by the prominent < unk > a. e. < unk > . during his undergraduate studies , he became editor of the union magazine , for which he produced a number of illustrated cartoons . increasingly interested in art , he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at ucl \\'s art school , the < unk > school of fine art ; he returned to his previous subject after coming to the opinion that – in his words – he never became more than \" a conventionally accomplished picture maker \" . this interlude had adversely affected his classical studies , and he received a second class < unk > on graduating . <eos>   wheeler began studying for a master of arts degree in classical studies , which he attained in 1912 . during this period , he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the ucl provost gregory foster , although he later criticised foster for transforming the university from \" a college in the truly academic sense [ into ] a < unk > < unk > as little like a college as a < unk > is like a man \" . it was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with tessa < unk > , a student then studying history at ucl , when they were both serving on the committee of the university college literary society . <eos>   during his studies , wheeler had developed his love of archaeology , having joined an excavation of < unk > < unk > , a romano @-@ british settlement in < unk > , in 1913 . considering a profession in the discipline , he won a < unk > that had been established jointly by the university of london and the society of antiquaries in memory of augustus < unk > franks . the prominent archaeologist sir arthur evans doubled the amount of money that went with the < unk > . wheeler \\'s proposed project had been to < unk > romano @-@ rhenish pottery , and with the grant he funded a trip to the rhineland in germany , there studying the roman pottery housed in local museums ; his research into this subject was never published . <eos>   at this period , there were very few jobs available within british archaeology ; as the later archaeologist stuart piggott related , \" the young wheeler was looking for a professional job where the profession had yet to be created . \" in 1913 wheeler secured a position as junior investigator for the english royal commission on historical monuments , who were embarking on a project to assess the state of all structures in the nation that pre @-@ dated 1714 . as part of this , he was first sent to < unk > in essex to assess late medieval buildings , although once that was accomplished he focused on studying the romano @-@ british remains of that county . in summer 1914 he married tessa in a low @-@ key , secular wedding ceremony , before they moved into wheeler \\'s parental home in < unk > hill . <eos>   <eos>   = = = first world war : 1914 – 18 = = = <eos>   <eos>   after the united kingdom \\'s entry into world war i in 1914 , wheeler volunteered for the armed forces . although preferring solitary to group activities , wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed < unk > . for the next seven months , he was posted as an instructor in the university of london officer training corps . it was during this period , in january 1915 , that a son was born to the wheelers , and named michael . michael was their only child , something that was a social anomaly at the time , although it is unknown if this was by choice or not . in may 1915 , wheeler transferred to the royal field artillery ( territorial force ) and shortly thereafter was appointed captain . in this position he was stationed at various bases across britain , often bringing his wife and child with him ; his responsibility was as a battery commander , initially of field guns and later of howitzers . <eos>   in october 1917 wheeler was posted to the 76th army field artillery brigade , one of the royal field artillery brigades under the direct control of the general officer commanding , third army . the brigade was then stationed in belgium , where it had been engaged in the battle of passchendaele against german troops along the western front . there , he was immediately placed in command of an artillery battery , replacing a major who had been poisoned by < unk > gas . being promoted to the rank of acting major , he was part of the left group of artillery covering the advancing allied infantry in the battle . throughout , he maintained < unk > with his wife , his sister amy , and his parents . after the allied victory in the battle , the brigade was transferred to italy . <eos>   wheeler and the brigade arrived in italy on 20 november , and proceeded through the italian < unk > to reach < unk > , where it had been sent to bolster the italian troops against a german and austro @-@ hungarian advance . as the russian republic removed itself from the war , the german army < unk > its efforts on the western front , and so in march 1918 wheeler \\'s brigade was ordered to leave italy , getting a train from < unk > to < unk > rouen in france . back on the western front , the brigade was assigned to the 2nd division , again part of julian < unk > \\'s third army , reaching a stable area of the front in april . here , wheeler was engaged in artillery fire for several months , before the british went on the offensive in august . on 24 august , in between the ruined villages of < unk > and < unk > , he led an expedition which captured two german field guns while under heavy fire from a castle mound ; he was later awarded the military cross for this action . wheeler continued as part of the british forces pushing westward until the german surrender in november 1918 . he was not < unk > for several months , instead being stationed at < unk > in germany until march ; during this time he wrote up his earlier research on romano @-@ rhenish pottery , making use of access to local museums , before returning to london in july 1919 . <eos>   <eos>   = = career = = <eos>   <eos>   <eos>   = = = national museum of wales :

examining and < unk > the historic structures of essex . in doing so , he produced his first publication , an academic paper on colchester \\'s roman < unk > gate which was published in the transactions of the essex archaeological society in 1920 . he soon followed this with two papers in the journal of roman studies ; the first offered a wider analysis of roman colchester , while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city \\'s temple of claudius which was destroyed by < unk > \\'s revolt . in doing so , he developed a reputation as a roman archaeologist in britain . he then submitted his research on romano @-@ rhenish pots to the university of london , on the basis of which he was awarded his doctorate of letters ; < unk > until his knighthood he styled himself as dr wheeler . he was unsatisfied with his job in the commission , unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army , and so began to seek out alternative employment . <eos>   he obtained a post as the keeper of archaeology at the national museum of wales , a job that also entailed becoming a lecturer in archaeology at the university college of south wales and monmouthshire . taking up this position , he moved to cardiff with his family in august 1920 , although he initially disliked the city . the museum was in < unk > ; prior to the war , construction had begun on a new purpose @-@ built building to house the collections . this had ceased during the conflict and the edifice was left abandoned during cardiff \\'s post @-@ war economic slump . wheeler recognised that wales was very divided regionally , with many welsh people having little loyalty to cardiff ; thus , he made a point of touring the country , lecturing to local societies about archaeology . according to the later archaeologist lydia c. carr , the wheelers \\' work for the cause of the museum was part of a wider \" cultural @-@ nationalist movement \" linked to growing welsh nationalism during this period ; for instance , the welsh nationalist party < unk > cymru was founded in 1925 . <eos>   wheeler was impatient to start excavations , and in july 1921 started a six @-@ week project to excavate at the roman fort of segontium ; accompanied by his wife , he used up his holiday to oversee the project . a second season of excavation at the site followed in 1922 . < unk > influenced by the writings of the archaeologist augustus pitt @-@ rivers , wheeler emphasised the need for a strong , developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation , believing in the need for strategic planning , or what he termed \" controlled discovery \" , with clear objectives in mind for a project . further emphasising the importance of prompt publication of research results , he wrote full seasonal reports for < unk > < unk > before publishing a full report , segontium and the roman occupation of wales . wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists , and two of the most prominent students to excavate with him at segontium were victor nash @-@ williams and ian richmond . <eos>   over the field seasons of 1924 and 1925 , wheeler ran excavations of the roman fort of y < unk > near < unk > , a project aided by his wife and two archaeological students , < unk > myres and christopher hawkes . during this project , he was visited by the prominent egyptologist sir flinders petrie and his wife hilda petrie ; wheeler greatly admired petrie \\'s emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies . wheeler published the results of his excavation in the roman fort near < unk > . he then began excavations at < unk > augusta , a roman site in < unk > , where he focused on revealing the roman amphitheatre . intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding , he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle @-@ market newspaper the daily mail . in doing so , he emphasised the < unk > and legendary associations that the site had with king arthur . in 1925 , oxford university press published wheeler \\'s first book for a general audience , prehistoric and roman wales ; he later expressed the opinion that it was not a good book . <eos>   in 1924 , the director of the national museum of wales , william evans < unk > , resigned amid ill health . wheeler applied to take on the role of his replacement , providing supportive < unk > from charles reed < unk > , robert < unk > , and h. j. < unk > . although he had no prior museum experience , he was successful in his application and was appointed director . he then employed a close friend , cyril fox , to take on the vacated position of keeper of archaeology . wheeler \\'s proposed reforms included extending the institution \\'s reach and influence throughout wales by building affiliations with regional museums , and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises . he obtained a £ 21 @,@ 367 donation from the wealthy < unk > william < unk > smith and appointed smith to be the museum \\'s treasurer , and also travelled to < unk > , london , where he successfully urged the british treasury to provide further funding for the museum . as a result , construction on the museum \\'s new building was able to continue , and it was officially opened by king george v in 1927 . <eos>   <eos>   = = = london museum : 1926 – 33 = = = <eos>   <eos>   upon the retirement of the keeper of the london museum , harmon oates , wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy . he had been considering a return to london for some time and eagerly agreed , taking on the post , which was based at lancaster house in the st james \\'s area , in july 1926 . in wales , many felt that wheeler had simply taken the directorship of the national museum to advance his own career prospects , and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along . wheeler himself disagreed , believing that he had left fox at the museum as his obvious successor , and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue . the position initially provided wheeler with an annual salary of £ 600 , which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family , who moved into a flat near to victoria station . <eos>   tessa \\'s biographer < unk > carr later commented that together , the wheelers \" < unk > the london museum \" . wheeler expressed his opinion that the museum \" had to be cleaned , < unk > , and < unk > ; in general , turned from a junk shop into a < unk > rational institution \" . focusing on < unk > the exhibits and developing a more efficient method of < unk > the artefacts , he also authored a short guide to the collections , before using the items in the museum to write three books : london and the vikings , london and the saxons , and london and the romans . upon his arrival , the treasury allocated the museum an annual budget of £ 5 @,@ 000 , which wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs . in 1930 , wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget , as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers , publications , and acquisitions , as well as a rise in the number of educational projects . with this additional funding , he was able to employ more staff and increase his own annual salary to £ 900 . <eos>   soon after joining the museum , wheeler was elected to the council of the society of antiquaries . through the society , he became involved in the debate as to who should finance archaeological supervision of building projects in greater london ; his argument was that the city of london corporation should provide the funding , although in 1926 it was agreed that the society itself would employ a director of excavation based in lancaster house to take on the position . also involved in the largely < unk > royal archaeological institute , wheeler organised its relocation to lancaster house . in 1927 , wheeler took on an unpaid < unk > at university college london , where he established a graduate < unk > course on archaeology ; one of the first to enroll was stuart piggott . in 1928 , wheeler < unk > an exhibit at ucl on \" recent work in british archaeology \" , for which he attracted much press attention . <eos>   wheeler was keen to continue archaeological < unk > outside london , undertaking excavations every year from 1926 to 1939 . after completing his excavation of the < unk > amphitheatre in 1928 , he began < unk > at the roman settlement and temple in lydney park , gloucestershire , having been invited to do so by the aristocratic landowner , charles bathurst . it was during these investigations that wheeler personally discovered the lydney < unk > of coinage . wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in 1932 as report on the excavation of the prehistoric , roman and post @-@ roman site in lydney park , gloucestershire , which piggott noted had \" set the pattern \" for all wheeler \\'s future excavation reports . <eos>   from there , wheeler was invited to direct a society of antiquaries excavation at the roman settlement of verulamium , which existed on land recently acquired by the corporation of st albans . he took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933 , before leaving a fifth season of excavation under the control of the archaeologist kathleen kenyon and the architect a. w. g. < unk > . wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site , and also liked its proximity to his home in london . he was particularly interested in searching for a pre @-@ roman iron age oppidum at the site , noting that the existence of a nearby < unk > settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence . with wheeler focusing his attention on potential iron age evidence , tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls ; wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project . after tessa wrote two interim reports , the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as verulamium : a < unk > and two roman cities , jointly written by wheeler and his wife . the report resulted in the first major published criticism of wheeler , produced by the young archaeologist < unk > myres in a review for antiquity ; although stating that there was much to praise about the work , he critiqued wheeler \\'s selective excavation , dubious dating , and < unk > . wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both myres and myres \\'s employer , christ church , oxford . <eos>   <eos>   = = = institute of archaeology : 1934 – 39 = = = <eos>   <eos>   wheeler had long desired to establish an academic institution devoted to archaeology that could be based in london . he hoped that it could become a centre in which to establish the

words , he hoped \" to convert archaeology into a discipline worthy of that name in all senses \" . he further described his intention that the institute should become \" a laboratory : a laboratory of archaeological science \" . many archaeologists shared his hopes , and to this end petrie had donated much of his collection of near eastern artefacts to wheeler , in the hope that it would be included in such an institution . wheeler was later able to persuade the university of london , a federation of institutions across the capital , to support the venture , and both he and tessa began raising funds from wealthy < unk > . in 1934 , the institute of archaeology was officially opened , albeit at this point without premises or academic staff ; the first students to enroll were rachel clay and barbara parker , who went on to have careers in the discipline . while wheeler – who was still keeper of the london museum – took on the role of honorary director of the institute , he installed the archaeologist kathleen kenyon as secretary of the management committee , describing her as \" a level @-@ headed person , with useful experience \" . <eos>   after ending his work at verulamium , wheeler turned his attention to the late iron age hill @-@ fort of maidan castle near to < unk > , dorset , where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937 . co @-@ directed by wheeler , tessa , and the curator of dorset county museum , charles drew , the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the society of antiquaries and the dorset field club . with around 100 assistants each season , the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in britain up to that point , with wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries . his excavation report was published in 1943 as maidan castle , dorset . the report \\'s publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of wheeler \\'s approach and interpretations ; in his review of the book , the archaeologist w. f. grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation , noting that wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio @-@ economic issues of the community at maidan castle , aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to british archaeology . over coming decades , as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of iron age britain , much of wheeler \\'s interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong , in particular by the work of the archaeologist niall < unk > . <eos>   in 1936 , wheeler embarked on a visit to the near east , sailing from < unk > to port said , where he visited the old kingdom tombs of < unk > . from there he went via sinai to palestine , lebanon , and syria . during this trip , he visited various archaeological projects , but was dismayed by the quality of their excavations ; in particular , he noted that the american @-@ run excavation at tel < unk > was adopting standards that had been rejected in britain twenty @-@ five years previously . he was away for six weeks , and upon his return to europe discovered that his wife tessa had died of a pulmonary < unk > after a minor operation on her toe . according to tessa \\'s biographer , for wheeler this discovery was \" the peak of mental misery , and marked the end of his ability to feel a certain kind of love \" . that winter , his father also died . by the summer of 1937 , he had embarked on a new romance , with a young woman named mavis de < unk > cole , who had first met wheeler when visiting the maidan castle excavations with her then @-@ lover , the painter augustus john . after she eventually agreed to his repeated requests for marriage , the two were < unk > early in 1939 in a ceremony held at caxton hall , with a reception at shelley house . they proceeded on a honeymoon to the middle east . <eos>   after a search that had taken several years , wheeler was able to secure a premises for the institute of archaeology : st. john \\'s lodge in regent \\'s park , central london . left empty since its use as a hospital during the first world war , the building was owned by the crown and was controlled by the first commissioner of works , william < unk > @-@ < unk > ; he was very sympathetic to archaeology , and leased the building to the institute at a low rent . the st. john \\'s lodge premises were officially opened on 29 april 1937 . during his speech at the ceremony , the university of london \\'s vice @-@ chancellor charles reed < unk > made it clear that the building was only intended as a temporary home for the institute , which it was hoped would be able to move to bloomsbury , the city \\'s academic hub . in his speech , the university \\'s chancellor , alexander cambridge , 1st earl of < unk > , compared the new institution to both the institute of historical research and the < unk > institute of art . <eos>   wheeler had also become president of the museums association , and in a presidential address given in belfast talked on the topic of preserving museum collections in war time , believing that britain \\'s involvement in a second european conflict was imminent . in anticipation of this event , in august 1939 he arranged for the london museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping . he was also awarded an honorary doctorate from bristol university , and at the award ceremony met the conservative party politician winston churchill , who was then engaged in writing his multi @-@ volume a history of the english @-@ speaking peoples ; churchill asked wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval britain , to which the latter agreed . <eos>   after maidan castle , wheeler turned his attention to france , where the archaeological investigation of iron age sites had < unk > behind developments in britain . there , he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of leslie scott , beginning with a survey tour of brittany in the winter of 1936 – 37 . after this , wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at camp d < unk > , near < unk > , < unk > . in addition to bringing many british archaeologists to work on the site , he hired six local breton < unk > to assist the project , coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local iron age tribes to defend themselves from the roman invasion led by julius caesar . meanwhile , scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of < unk > , near < unk > . in july 1939 , the project focused its attention on normandy , with excavations beginning at the iron age hill forts of camp de canada and < unk > . they were brought to an abrupt halt in september 1939 as the second world war broke out in europe , and the team evacuated back to britain . wheeler \\'s excavation report , co @-@ written with katherine richardson , was eventually published as hill @-@ forts of northern france in 1957 . <eos>   <eos>   = = = second world war : 1939 – 45 = = = <eos>   <eos>   wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with nazi germany for a year prior to the outbreak of hostilities ; he believed that the united kingdom \\'s involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the munich agreement in september 1938 . < unk > for the armed services , he was assigned to assemble the 48th light anti @-@ aircraft battery at < unk > , where he set about recruiting volunteers , including his son . as the 48th swelled in size , it was converted into the 42nd mobile light anti @-@ aircraft regiment in the royal artillery , which consisted of four batteries and was led by wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as commanding officer . given the nickname of \" flash < unk > \" by those serving under him , he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training . having been appointed secretary of the society of antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940 , he travelled to london to deal with society affairs on various occasions . in 1941 wheeler was awarded a fellowship of the british academy . cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named clive < unk > , who lambasted wheeler as \" that < unk > < unk > \" . when wheeler discovered < unk > in bed with his wife , he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in march 1942 . <eos>   in the summer of 1941 , wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against german and italian forces in the north african campaign . in september , they set sail from glasgow aboard the < unk > empress of russia ; because the mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces , they were forced to travel via the cape of good hope , before taking shore leave in durban . there , wheeler visited the local < unk > to compare them with the settlements of iron age britain . the ship docked in aden , where wheeler and his men again took shore leave . they soon reached the british @-@ controlled suez , where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the great < unk > lake . there , wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to jerusalem , where he visited petrie on his hospital deathbed . back in egypt , he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a wellington bomber on a bombing raid against axis forces , to better understand what it was like for aircrew to be fired on by an anti @-@ aircraft battery . <eos>   serving with the eighth army , wheeler was present in north africa when the axis armies pushed the allies back to el < unk > . he was also part of the allied counter @-@ push , taking part in the second battle of el < unk > and the advance on axis @-@ held tripoli . on the way he became concerned that the archaeological sites of north africa were being threatened both by the fighting and the occupying forces . after the british secured control of libya , wheeler visited tripoli and < unk > magna , where he found that roman remains had been damaged and vandalised by british troops ; he brought about reforms to prevent this , lecturing to the troops on the importance of preserving archaeology , making many monuments out @-@ of @-@ bounds , and ensuring that the royal air force changed its plans to construct a radar station in the midst of a roman settlement . aware that the british were planning to invade and occupy the italian island of sicily , he insisted that measures be introduced to preserve the historic and archaeological monuments on the island . <eos>   promoted to the rank of brigadier , after the german surrender in north africa , wheeler was sent to algiers where he was part of the staff committee planning the invasion of italy . there , he learned that the india office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed director general of archaeology in india . although he had never been to the country , he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of italy first . as intended , wheeler and his 12th anti @-@ aircraft brigade then took part in the invasion of sicily and then mainland italy , where they were ordered to use their anti @-@ aircraft guns to protect the british 10th corps . as the allies advanced north through italy , wheeler spent time in naples and then capri , where he met various < unk > who had anti @-@ fascist sympathies . <eos>   wheeler left italy in november 1943 and returned to london . there , he resigned as the director of the london museum and focused on organising the institute of archaeology , preparing it for its adoption of a new director , v. gordon childe , after the war . he also resigned as director of the society of antiquaries , but was appointed the group \\'s representative to the newly formed council for british archaeology . he developed a relationship with a woman named kim collingridge , and asked her to marry him . as she was a devout roman catholic , he officially converted to the religion , something which shocked many of his friends , who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith . he then set sail for bombay aboard a transport ship , the city of exeter , in february 1944 . <eos>   <eos>   = = = archaeological survey of india : 1944 – 48 = = = <eos>   <eos>   wheeler arrived in bombay in the spring of 1944 . there , he was welcomed by the city \\'s governor , john < unk > , before heading by train to delhi and then < unk > , where the headquarters of the archaeological survey of india were located . wheeler had been suggested for the job by archibald wavell , the viceroy of india , who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist leonard woolley , who had authored a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the british @-@ controlled subcontinent . wheeler recognised this state of affairs , in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment , commenting that \" we \\'re back in 1850 \" . he initially found much to dislike in india , and in his letters to friends in britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward indians : he stated that \" they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly ... i already find myself regarding them as ill @-@ made clockwork toys rather than as human beings , and i find myself bullying them most brutally . \" he expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle , and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them . <eos>   from the beginning of his tenure , he sought to distance himself from previous director @-@ generals and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors . < unk > with a four @-@ year contract , wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from britain , glyn daniel and stuart piggott , to aid him in reforming the archaeological survey , although they declined the offer . he then toured the subcontinent , seeking to meet all of the survey \\'s staff members . he had drawn up a < unk > containing research questions that he wanted the survey to focus on ; these included understanding the period between the bronze age indus valley civilization and the achaemenid empire , discerning the socio @-@ cultural background to the < unk > , dating the < unk > invasion , and establishing a dating system for southern india prior to the sixth century ce . during his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the archaeological survey , and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a national museum of archaeology , to be built in new delhi . <eos>   in october 1944 , he opened his six @-@ month archaeological field school in < unk > , where he instructed various students from across india in the methodologies of the discipline . wheeler became very fond of his students , with one of them , b. b. lal , later commenting that \" behind the < unk > exterior , sir mortimer had a very kind and sympathetic heart \" . throughout his period in india , his students were some of the only individuals to whom wheeler warmed ; more widely , he was annoyed by what he saw as the idleness , incompetence and corruption of indian society . initially focusing on the northwest of the subcontinent , wheeler was particularly fascinated by the bronze age indus valley civilization . on his initial inspection of the indus valley sites of mohenjo @-@ daro and harappa , he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements . he later led a more detailed excavation at harappa , where he exposed further fortifications and established a < unk > for the settlement . <eos>   turning his attention to southern india , wheeler discovered remnants of a roman < unk > in a museum , and began excavations at arikamedu , revealing a port from the first century ce which had traded in goods from the roman empire . the excavation had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat , although it was during the excavation that world war ii ended ; in celebration , wheeler gave all his workers an extra < unk > for the day . it has since been alleged that while wheeler took credit for discovering the significance of this site , it had previously been established by a. < unk > , the superintendent of the government museum in madras , and the french archaeologist < unk > dubreuil , with wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution . he later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in < unk > , mysore , which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern india . <eos>   wheeler established a new archaeological journal , ancient india , planning for it to be published twice a year . he had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays ; the first issue was released in january 1946 , and he would release three further volumes during his stay . wheeler married kim collingridge in < unk > , before he and his wife took part in an indian cultural mission to iran . the indian government had deemed wheeler ideal to lead the group , which departed via train to < unk > before visiting < unk > , tehran , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , and < unk > . wheeler enjoyed the trip , and was envious of tehran \\'s archaeological museum and library , which was far in advance of anything then found in india . crossing into iraq , in baghdad the team caught a flight back to delhi . in 1946 , he was involved in a second cultural mission , this time to afghanistan , where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient < unk > and visited the archaeology of < unk > . <eos>   wheeler was present during the 1947 partition of india into the dominion of pakistan and the union of india and the accompanying ethnic violence between hindu and muslim communities . he was unhappy with how these events had affected the archaeological survey , complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of pakistan and no longer able to work for him . he was based in new delhi when the city was < unk > by sectarian violence , and attempted to help many of his muslim staff members escape from the hindu @-@ majority city unharmed . he further helped smuggle muslim families out of the city hospital , where they had taken refuge from a violent hindu mob . as india neared independence from the british empire , the political situation had changed significantly ; by october 1947 he was one of the last british individuals in a high @-@ up position within the country \\'s governing establishment , and recognised that many indian nationalists wanted him to also leave . <eos>   as their relationship had become increasingly strained , his wife had left and returned to britain . although hoping to leave his post in india several months early , he was concerned for his economic prospects , and desperately searched for a new job position . through friends in the british archaeological community , he was offered a job as the secretary of the royal commission on ancient monuments for wales , although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down . instead , he agreed to take up a chair in the archaeology of the roman < unk > at the institute of archaeology . in addition , the pakistani minister of education invited him to become the archaeological < unk > to the pakistani government ; he agreed to also take up this position , on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three . <eos>   <eos>   = = later life = = <eos>   <eos>   <eos>   = = = between britain and pakistan : 1948 – 52 = = = <eos>   <eos>   returning to london , wheeler moved into the hallam street flat where his son and daughter @-@ in @-@ law were living . wheeler and the latter disliked each other , and so in summer 1950 he moved out and began renting an apartment in mount street . a year later he moved into his wife \\'s house in < unk > street , in an unsuccessful hope of < unk > their relationship . taking up his part @-@ time < unk > at the institute of archaeology , he began to lecture to students almost every day . there , he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director , childe , despite their strong personal and professional differences . in april 1949 , after the retirement of cyril fox , wheeler was nominated for the < unk > of the society of antiquaries , but lost to james mann ; many archaeologists , including childe and o. g. s. crawford , resigned from the society in protest , deeming wheeler to have been a far more appropriate candidate for the position . wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the society . in 1950 he was awarded the petrie medal , and in 1952 was knighted . that same year he was invited to give the norton lectures for the archaeological institute of america , and while in the united states was also awarded the lucy < unk > < unk > medal at pennsylvania . he nevertheless disliked the country , and in later life exhibited anti @-@ americanism . <eos>   wheeler spent three months in pakistan during early 1949 , where he was engaged in organising the fledgling pakistani archaeological department with the aid of former members of the archaeological survey and new students whom he recruited . the minister of education , < unk > < unk > , was sympathetic to wheeler \\'s plans , and the government agreed to establish a national museum of pakistan in karachi , which opened in april 1950 . wheeler himself was appointed the first president of the pakistani museums association , and found himself as a mediator in the arguments between india and pakistan over the < unk > of archaeological and historic artefacts following the partition . he also wrote a work of archaeological propaganda for the newly formed state , five thousand years of pakistan ( 1950 ) . <eos>   to instruct new pakistani students in the methods of archaeology , in early 1950 wheeler ran a training excavation at mohenjo @-@ daro ; there , he was joined by the british student leslie alcock , who spoke both punjabi and < unk > and who was appointed a site supervisor by wheeler . this excavation proved to be the only one for which wheeler would not write and publish a full excavation report . instead , he made reference to its findings in his book the indus civilization , published as part of the series the cambridge history of india . his relationship with the pakistani government had become strained , and so he declined to return to work for them for a third year . <eos>   wheeler had been keen to return to excavation in britain . based on the one he had organised in india , wheeler developed an archaeological training course , which he ran at verulamium in the summer of 1949 to instruct british students in the methodologies of excavation . in summer 1950 , he was invited by the royal commission on historical monuments to direct a trial excavation at < unk > hill in dorset . it was a leisurely project which he treated as a seaside holiday . he was invited by the ancient monuments department of the ministry of works to excavate the < unk > iron age < unk > in north riding , yorkshire , which he proceeded to do over the summers of 1951 and 1952 . aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the british archaeological scene , he was joined by alcock and alcock \\'s wife , among others . wheeler published his report on the site in 1954 . <eos>   in 1949 wheeler was appointed honorary secretary of the british academy after < unk > g. kenyon stepped down from the position . according to piggott , the institution had \" < unk > drifted into < unk > without the excuse of being venerable \" , and wheeler devoted much time attempting to < unk > the organisation and ensured that charles webster was appointed president . together , wheeler and webster sought to increase the number of younger members of the academy , increasing the number of < unk > who were permitted to join and proposing that those over 75 years of age not be permitted to serve on the organisation \\'s council ; this latter measure was highly controversial , and though defeated in 1951 , wheeler and webster were able to push it through in 1952 . in doing so , piggott stated , wheeler helped rid the society of its \" self @-@ perpetuating < unk > \" . to aid him in these projects , wheeler employed a personal assistant , molly myers , who remained with him for the rest of his life . <eos>   <eos>   = = = popular fame : 1952 – 69 = = = <eos>   <eos>   in 1956 , wheeler retired from his part @-@ time < unk > at the institute of archaeology . childe was also retiring from his position of director that year , and wheeler involved himself in the arguments surrounding who should replace him . wheeler vocally opposed the nomination of < unk > grimes , deeming his career undistinguished ; instead , he championed glyn daniel as a candidate , although ultimately grimes was selected . that year , wheeler \\'s marriage broke down , and he moved from his wife \\'s house to a former < unk > at 27 < unk > street in central london . from 1954 to 1959 , he served as the president of the society of antiquaries , and after resigning supported ian richmond as his replacement ; however , joan evans was selected . from 1964 to 1966 he served as chairman of the ancient monuments board , stepping down when he concluded that he was too old for the role . in december 1963 , wheeler underwent a prostate operation that went wrong , and was hospitalised for over a month . in november 1967 , wheeler became a companion of honour , and in 1968 he became a fellow of the royal society . <eos>   <eos>   = = = = media fame and public archaeology = = = = <eos>   <eos>   wheeler became famous in britain as \" the embodiment of popular archaeology through the medium of television \" . in 1952 , wheeler was invited to be a < unk > on the new bbc television series , animal , < unk > , mineral ? . based on the american quiz programme what in the world ? , the show was hosted by glyn daniel and featured three experts in archaeology , anthropology , and natural history being asked to identify artefacts which had been selected from various museums . however , wheeler is alleged to have prepared for the show by checking beforehand which objects had been temporarily removed from display . the show proved popular with british audiences , and would air for six more years . it brought wheeler to public attention , resulting in a television personality of the year award for him in 1954 . he also appeared in an episode of buried treasure , an archaeology show also hosted by daniel , in which the pair travelled to denmark to discuss < unk > man . in 1957 , he appeared in a second episode of buried treasure , for which he travelled to pakistan to discuss that nation \\'s archaeology , and in 1958 again appeared in an episode , this time on the site of great zimbabwe in southern rhodesia . in 1959 he presented his own three @-@ part series on the < unk > that was rome , for which he travelled to < unk > \\'s wall , pompeii , and < unk > magna ; the show failed to secure high ratings , and was wheeler \\'s last major foray into television . meanwhile , he also made appearances on bbc radio , initially featuring on the john irving series the archaeologist , but later presenting his own eight @-@ part series on roman britain and also appearing on the series asian club , which was aimed primarily at newly arrived migrants from the indian subcontinent . <eos>   from 1954 onward , wheeler began to devote an increasing amount of his time to encouraging greater public interest in archaeology , and it was in that year that he obtained an agent . oxford university press also published two of his books in 1954 . the first was a book on archaeological methodologies , archaeology from the earth , which was translated into various languages . the second was rome beyond the imperial frontier , discussing evidence for roman activity at sites like arikamedu and segontium . in 1955 wheeler released his episodic autobiography , still < unk > , which had sold over 70 @,@ 000 copies by the end of the year . in 1959 , wheeler wrote early india and pakistan , which was published as part as daniel \\'s \" ancient peoples and places \" series for thames and hudson ; as with many earlier books , he was criticised for rushing to conclusions . <eos>   he authored the section entitled \" ancient india \" for piggott \\'s edited volume the dawn of civilisation , which was published by thames and hudson in 1961 , before writing an introduction for roger wood \\'s photography book roman africa in colour , which was also published by thames and hudson . he then agreed to edit a series for the publisher , known as \" new aspects of antiquity \" , through which they released a variety of archaeological works . the rival publisher < unk > & < unk > had also persuaded wheeler to work for them , securing him to write many sections of their book , < unk > of the east . they also published his 1968 book flames over < unk > , in which wheeler discussed < unk > and the persian empire in the year that it was conquered by alexander the great . <eos>   in 1954 , the tour company < unk > swan invited wheeler to provide lectures on the archaeology of ancient greece aboard their hellenic cruise line , which he did in 1955 . in 1957 , he then gave a guided tour of the archaeology of the indian subcontinent for the rival tour company < unk > and < unk > . after swans appointed him to the position of chairman of their hellenic cruise division , he made two fortnight tours a year , in spring and summer . in late 1969 he conducted the swans tour to the indian subcontinent , visiting the south and east of the republic as well as ceylon . during this period , wheeler had kept in contact with many of his friends and colleagues in india and pakistan , helping to secure them work and funding where possible . <eos>   wheeler had continued his archaeological investigations , and in 1954 led an expedition to the somme and < unk > de calais where he sought to obtain more information on the french iron age to supplement that gathered in the late 1930s . pakistan \\'s ministry of education invited wheeler to return to their country in october 1956 . here , he undertook test excavations at < unk > to determine a chronology of the site . in 1965 , he agreed to take on the position of president of the < unk > research committee , which had been established to promote the findings of excavations at < unk > castle in somerset run by his friends < unk > radford and alcock ; the project ended in 1970 . he also agreed to sit as chairman of the archaeological committee overseeing excavations at york minster , work which occupied him into the 1970s . wheeler had also continued his work with museums , campaigning for greater state funding for them . while he had become a trustee of the institution in 1963 , he achieved publicity for vocally criticising the british museum as \" a mountainous corpse \" , < unk > it as being poorly managed and overcrowded with artefacts . the bbc staged a public debate with the museum director frank francis . <eos>   <eos>   = = = = british academy and unesco = = = = <eos>   <eos>   as honorary secretary of the british academy , wheeler focused on increasing the organisation \\'s revenues , thus enabling it to expand its remit . he developed personal relationships with various employees at the british treasury , and offered the academy \\'s services as an < unk > in dealing with the egypt exploration society , the british school at athens , the british school at rome , the british school at < unk > , the british school in iraq , and the british school at jerusalem , all of which were then directly funded independently by the treasury . accepting this offer , the treasury agreed to double its funding of the academy to £ 5 @,@ 000 a year . < unk > various charitable foundations , from 1955 wheeler also secured funding from both the pilgrim trust and the < unk > foundation , and in 1957 then secured additional funding from the rockefeller foundation . <eos>   with this additional money , the academy was able to organise a survey of the state of the humanities and social sciences in the united kingdom , < unk > a report that was published by oxford university press in 1961 as research in the humanities and the social sciences . on the basis of this report , wheeler was able to secure a dramatic rise in funding from the british treasury ; they increased their annual grant to £ 25 @,@ 000 , and promised that this would increase to £ 50 @,@ 000 shortly after . according to his later biographer jacquetta hawkes , in doing so wheeler raised the position of the academy to that of \" the main source of official patronage for the humanities \" within the united kingdom , while piggott stated that he set the organisation upon its \" modern course \" . <eos>   to improve britain \\'s cultural influence abroad , wheeler had been urging the establishment of a british institute of history and archaeology in east africa , touring east africa itself in august 1955 . in 1956 the academy requested £ 6 @,@ 000 from the treasury to fund this new institution , to which they eventually agreed in 1959 . the institute was initially established in dar es salaam in 1961 , although later relocated to < unk > . meanwhile , wheeler had also been campaigning for the establishment of a british institute of persian studies , a project which was supported by the british embassy in tehran ; they hoped that it would rival the successful french institute in the city . in 1960 , the treasury agreed , with the new institution being housed on the premises of the university of tehran . he further campaigned for the establishment of a british institute in japan , although these ideas were scrapped amid the british financial crisis of 1967 . <eos>   wheeler retained an active interest in the running of these british institutions abroad ; in 1967 he visited the british school in jerusalem amid the six @-@ day war between israel and its arab neighbours , and in january 1968 visited the persian institute with the archaeologist max mallowan and mallowan \\'s wife < unk > christie , there inspecting the excavations at < unk > . in 1969 he proceeded to the italian city of rome to inspect the british school there . that year , he resigned as honorary secretary of the academy . the position became a salaried , professional one , with the < unk > derek allen taking on the position . <eos>   < unk > his stature within the archaeological establishment , the government appointed wheeler as the british representative on a unesco project to undertake a programme of rescue archaeology in the nile valley ahead of the construction of the < unk > dam , which was going to flood large areas of egypt and sudan . < unk > securing uk funding for the project , he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the british government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the abu < unk > temples . in october 1968 , he took part in a unesco visit to pakistan to assess the state of mohenjo @-@ daro , writing the project \\'s report on how the archaeological site could best be preserved . his involvement with unesco continued for the rest of his life , and in march 1973 he was invited to the organisation \\'s

at the university of southampton organised a conference on the subject of \" the iron age and its < unk > \" to celebrate wheeler \\'s < unk > birthday . wheeler attended the event , whose conference proceedings were published as a < unk > for the < unk > . in spring 1973 , wheeler returned to bbc television for two episodes of the archaeology @-@ themed series chronicle in which he discussed his life and career . the episodes were well received , and wheeler became a close friend of the show \\'s producer , david < unk > . <eos>   in the 1970s , wheeler became increasingly < unk > and came to rely largely on his assistant , molly myres , to organise his affairs . amid increasing ill health , in september 1973 he moved full @-@ time into myres \\'s house in < unk > , surrey , although he continued to use his central london flat during day @-@ trips to the city . there , he authored a final book , my archaeological mission to india and pakistan , although much of the text was culled from his previous publications ; it was published by thames and hudson in 1976 . after suffering a stroke , wheeler died at myers \\' home on 22 july 1976 . in < unk > , the british academy , royal academy , and royal society flew their flags at half @-@ mast . wheeler \\'s funeral was held with military < unk > at a local < unk > , while a larger memorial service was held in st james \\'s church , piccadilly in november . <eos>   <eos>   = = personal life = = <eos>   <eos>   wheeler was known as \" < unk > \" among friends . he divided opinion among those who knew him , with some loving and others < unk > him , and during his lifetime he was often criticised on both scholarly and moral grounds . the archaeologist max mallowan asserted that he \" was a delightful , light @-@ hearted and amusing companion , but those close to him knew that he could be a dangerous opponent if threatened with frustration \" . his charm offensives were often condemned as being < unk > . during excavations , he was known as an authoritarian leader , but favoured those whom he thought exhibited bravery by standing up to his authority . hence , he has been termed \" a benevolent dictator \" . he was meticulous in his writings , and would repeatedly revise and rewrite both pieces for publication and personal letters . throughout his life , he was a heavy smoker . <eos>   wheeler expressed the view that he was \" the least political of mortals \" . despite not taking a strong interest in politics , wheeler was described by his biographer as \" a natural conservative \" ; for instance , during his youth he was strongly critical of the < unk > and their cause of greater legal rights for women . nevertheless , he was \" usually happy to advance young women professionally \" , something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them . he expressed little interest in his relatives ; in later life he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties . <eos>   wheeler was married three times . in may 1914 , wheeler married tessa < unk > . tessa became an accomplished archaeologist , and they collaborated until she died in 1936 . their only child , a son michael , was born in january 1915 ; he became a barrister . following tessa \\'s death , in 1939 , wheeler married mavis de < unk > cole , although their relationship was strained ; cole \\'s diaries revealed that wheeler physically hit her when she annoyed him . in 1945 mortimer wheeler married his third wife , margaret \" kim \" collingridge , although they became estranged in 1956 ; they never divorced as a result of her devout catholicism . meanwhile , wheeler was well known for his conspicuous promiscuity , favouring young women for one night stands , many of whom were his students . he was further known for having casual sex in public places . this behaviour led to much emotional suffering among his various wives and < unk > , of which he was aware . as a result of this behaviour , later archaeologist gabriel moshenska informed a reporter from the daily mail that wheeler had developed a reputation as \" a bit of a < unk > and a sex pest and an incredible < unk > as well \" . <eos>   <eos>   = = reception and legacy = = <eos>   <eos>   wheeler has been termed \" the most famous british archaeologist of the twentieth century \" by archaeologists gabriel moshenska and tim schadla @-@ hall . highlighting his key role in encouraging interest in archaeology throughout british society , they stated that his \" mastery of public archaeology was founded on his keen eye for value and a < unk > \\'s willingness to package and sell the past \" . this was an issue about which wheeler felt very strongly ; writing his obituary for the < unk > memoirs of < unk > of the royal society , the english archaeologist stuart piggott noted that wheeler placed \" great importance to the archaeologist \\'s obligation to the public , on whose support the prosecution of his subject ultimately depended . \" <eos>   piggott believed that wheeler \\'s greatest impact was as \" the great innovator in field techniques \" , comparing him in this respect to pitt @-@ rivers . piggott stated that the \" importance of wheeler \\'s contribution to archaeological technique , enormous and far @-@ reaching , lies in the fact that in the early 1920s he not only appreciated and understood what pitt @-@ rivers had done , but saw that his work could be used as a basis for adaptation , development and improvement . \" l. c. carr stated that it was for his methodological developments , oft termed \" the wheeler method \" , that wheeler was best known ; in this she contrasted him with those archaeologists who were best known for their associations with a specific archaeological site , such as arthur evans and < unk > or leonard woolley and < unk > . <eos>   wheeler was well known for his publications on archaeological matters ; carr stated that both wheeler and his first wife emphasised \" technical < unk > and a full presentation of materials unearthed , as well as a literary discussion of their meaning calculated to appeal to a larger audience . \" focusing on wheeler \\'s publications regarding south asian archaeology , < unk > < unk > noted that he \" produced an assemblage of image @-@ objects that embodied the precision he demanded from excavation photography . \" mallowan noted that \" < unk > and swift presentation of results was more important to him than profound scholarship , although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was < unk > . \" jacquetta hawkes commented that he made errors in his interpretation of the archaeological evidence because he was \" sometimes too sure of being right , too ready to accept his own authority \" . she asserted that while wheeler was not an original thinker , he had \" a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces , however small , in its < unk > significance . \" <eos>   piggott claimed that wheeler \\'s appointment as director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india represented \" the most remarkable archaeological achievement of his career , an enormous challenge accepted and surmounted in the < unk > and authoritarian terms within which he could best deploy his powers as administrator and < unk > . no other archaeologist of the time , it seems fair to remark , could have come near to attaining his command of < unk > strategy and often ruthless tactics which won him the < unk > admiration and touching devotion of his indian staff . \" the indian archaeologist < unk > k. chakrabarti later stated that wheeler \\'s accomplishments while in india were \" considerable \" , particularly given the socio @-@ political turmoil of independence and partition . chakrabarti stated that wheeler had contributed to south asian archaeology in various ways : by establishing a \" total view \" of the region \\'s development from the < unk > onward , by introducing new archaeological techniques and methodologies to the subcontinent , and by encouraging indian universities to begin archaeological research . ultimately , chakrabarti was of the opinion that wheeler had \" prepared the archaeology of the subcontinent for its transition to modernity in the post @-@ partition period . \" similarly , peter johansen praised wheeler for < unk > and < unk > indian archaeology and for \" < unk > a clearly defined body of techniques and methods for field and laboratory work and training . \" <eos>   on wheeler \\'s death , < unk > < unk > of deccan college , pune , described him as \" well known among old world archaeologists in the united states \" , particularly for his book archaeology from the earth and his studies of the indus valley civilisation . in its 2013 obituary of the english archaeologist mick aston , british archaeology magazine – the publication of the council for british archaeology – described aston as \" the mortimer wheeler of our times \" because despite the strong differences between their personalities , both had done much to bring archaeology to the british public . however , writing in 2011 , moshenska and schadla @-@ hall asserted that wheeler \\'s reputation has not undergone significant revision among archaeologists , but that instead he had come to be remembered as \" a < unk > and slightly eccentric figure \" whom they termed \" naughty < unk > \" . carr described the institute of archaeology as \" one of the [ wheeler ] couple \\'s most permanent memorials . \" <eos>   <eos>   = = = biographies and studies = = = <eos>

wheeler : < unk > in archaeology . hawkes admitted she had developed \" a very great liking \" for wheeler , having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the university of cambridge . she believed that he had \" a < unk > energy \" , with his accomplishments in india being \" almost superhuman \" . ultimately , she thought of him as being \" an epic hero in an anti @-@ heroic age

species of allosaurus = <eos>   <eos>   there have been a number of potential species assigned to the < unk > dinosaur genus allosaurus since its description in 1877 by othniel charles marsh , but only a handful are still regarded as valid . allosaurus was originally described from material from the upper jurassic morrison formation of the western united states of america ; the type species a. fragilis became one of the best @-@ known species of dinosaur . <eos>   the genus allosaurus was part of the marsh / cope \" bone wars \" of the late 19th century , and its taxonomy became increasingly confused due to the competition , with several genera and species named by cope and marsh now regarded as synonyms of allosaurus or a. fragilis . since the description of allosaurus , scientists have proposed additional species from such far @-@ flung < unk > as portugal , siberia , and tanzania . <eos>   <eos>   = = < unk > about type specimen = = <eos>   <eos>   the issue of synonyms is complicated by the type specimen of allosaurus fragillis ( catalogue number ypm 1930 ) being extremely fragmentary , consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae , limb bone fragments , rib fragments , and a tooth . because of this , several scientists have noted that the type specimen , and thus the genus allosaurus itself or at least the species a. fragillis , is technically a nomen dubium ( \" dubious name \" , based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify ) . in an attempt to fix this situation , gregory s. paul and kenneth carpenter ( 2010 ) submitted a petition to the < unk > to have the name a. fragillis officially transferred to the more complete specimen < unk > ( as a < unk > ) . this request is currently pending review . <eos>   <eos>   = = < unk > valid species = = <eos>   <eos>   it is unclear how many species of allosaurus there were . eight species have been considered potentially valid since 1988 ( a. amplexus , a. atrox , a. europaeus , the type species a. fragilis , the as @-@ yet not formally described \" a. jimmadseni \" , a. < unk > , a. maximus , and a. tendagurensis ) , although only about half are usually considered valid at any given time . there are also at least ten dubious or undescribed species that have been assigned to allosaurus over the years , along with the species belonging to genera now sunk into allosaurus . in the most recent review of basal tetanuran theropods , only a. fragilis ( including a. amplexus and a. atrox ) , \" a. jimmadseni \" ( as an unnamed species ) , and a. tendagurensis were accepted as potentially valid species , with a. europaeus not yet proposed and a. maximus assigned to saurophaganax . <eos>   a. fragilis is the type species and was named by marsh in 1877 . it is known from the remains of at least sixty individuals , all found in the kimmeridgian – tithonian upper jurassic @-@ age morrison formation of the united states , spread across the states of colorado , montana , new mexico , oklahoma , south dakota , utah , and wyoming . details of the humerus ( upper arm ) of a. fragilis have been used as diagnostic among morrison theropods , but the discovery of \" a. jimmadseni \" indicates that this will no longer be the case at the species level . <eos>   a. amplexus was named by gregory s. paul for giant morrison allosaur remains , and included in his conception < unk > maximus ( later saurophaganax ) . a. amplexus was originally coined by cope in 1878 as the type species of his new genus < unk > , and is based on what is now amnh < unk > , parts of three vertebrae , a coracoid , and a < unk > . following paul \\'s work , this species has been accepted as a synonym of a. fragilis . <eos>   allosaurus material from portugal was first reported in 1999 on the basis of < unk > / < unk > , a partial skeleton including a < unk > , vertebrae , ribs , < unk > , chevrons , part of the < unk > , and hindlimbs . this specimen was assigned to a. fragilis , but the subsequent discovery of a partial skull and neck ( ml 415 ) near < unk > , in the kimmeridgian @-@ age porto novo member of the < unk > formation , spurred the naming of the new species a. europaeus . it differs from other species of allosaurus in cranial details . however , more material may show it to be a. fragilis , as originally described . <eos>   daniel chure \\'s work on morrison < unk > remains has been responsible , directly or indirectly , for \" a. jimmadseni \" and a. maximus . \" a. jimmadseni \" is the proposed name for a new species of morrison allosaur , based on a nearly complete skeleton and skull . a. sp . 2 , as it is also known , differs from a. fragilis in several anatomical details including a jugal or < unk > with a straight lower margin , and is also found only in the salt < unk > member of the morrison formation , with a. fragilis only present in the higher < unk > basin member . a. maximus was coined by david k. smith for chure \\'s saurophaganax maximus , a taxon created by chure in 1995 for giant < unk > remains from the morrison of oklahoma . these remains had been known as < unk > , but that name was already in use , leading chure to propose a substitute . smith , in his 1998 analysis of variation , concluded that s. maximus was not different enough from allosaurus to be a separate genus , but did warrant its own species , a. maximus . this < unk > was rejected in the most recent review of basal < unk > . <eos>   <eos>   = = biological variation , a. atrox , and a. fragilis = = <eos>   <eos>   the perception that there were two common allosaurus species in the morrison formation was popularized in gregory s. paul \\'s 1988 book predatory dinosaurs of the world . paul proposed that a. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build compared to a postulated second species a. atrox , and was not a different gender due to rarity . allosaurus atrox was originally named by marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus , creosaurus , and is based on ypm 1890 , an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull , portions of nine tail vertebrae , two hip vertebrae , an < unk > , and ankle and foot bones . although the idea of two common morrison allosaur species has had support in semi @-@ technical and popular works , it has generally been rejected in the technical literature . <eos>   david k. smith , examining allosaurus fossils by quarry , found that the cleveland lloyd dinosaur < unk > ( utah ) specimens are generally smaller than those from < unk > bluff ( wyoming ) or < unk > young university \\'s dry mesa < unk > ( colorado ) , but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites . a later study by smith incorporating garden park ( colorado ) and dinosaur national monument ( utah ) specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation ; skull variation was most common and was < unk > , suggesting individual variation was responsible . further work on size @-@ related variation again found no consistent differences , although the dry mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the < unk > , an ankle bone . kenneth carpenter , using skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site , found wide variation between individuals , calling into question previous species @-@ level distinctions based such features as the shape of the horns , and the proposed differentiation of \" a. jimmadseni \" based on the shape of the jugal . <eos>   <eos>   = = < unk > and synonymous

1912 , is a typographical error for a. fragilis . marsh \\'s a. ferox ( 1896 ; not to be confused with his 1884 labrosaurus ferox , also part of allosaurus taxonomy ) was coined for a partial skull in a footnote , and has been recognized as a specimen of a fragilis . a. lucaris , another marsh name , was given to a partial skeleton in 1878 . he later decided it warranted its own genus , labrosaurus , but this has not been accepted , and a. lucaris is also regarded as another specimen of a. fragilis . allosaurus lucaris , is known mostly from vertebrae , sharing characters with allosaurus . paul and carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species , ypm 1931 , was from a younger age than allosaurus , and might represent a different genus . however , they found that the specimen was < unk > , and thus a. lucaris was a nomen dubium . \" a. < unk > \" , an informally described species coined by pickering in 1996 , is a < unk > of the a. atrox versus a. fragilis debate using a better specimen to represent the a. atrox form , and has not been recognized . <eos>   several species coined in genera other than allosaurus are also now thought to be synonymous with a. fragilis . labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw , with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw , and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down . later researchers suggested that the bone was < unk > , showing an injury to the living animal , and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction . it is recognized as most likely a specimen of a. fragilis . allosaurus valens is a < unk > for < unk > valens accidentally used by friedrich von < unk > in 1932 ; < unk > valens itself may also < unk > to allosaurus fragilis , as gilmore suggested in 1920 . < unk > < unk > , based on a scrap of < unk > marsh first thought to be a mammalian jaw , may or may not be the same as allosaurus . <eos>   <eos>

occasionally been referred to allosaurus , but recent reviews have listed it as dubious theropod species megalosaurus < unk > , or included it in ceratosaurus sp . allosaurus stechowi was described in 1920 by < unk > as labrosaurus stechowi for isolated ceratosaurus @-@ like teeth from the < unk > beds of tanzania . with the < unk > of labrosaurus and allosaurus , donald f. < unk > listed it as a species of allosaurus , but it is now either assigned to ceratosaurus sp . or considered a dubious < unk > . <eos>   there are also several species left over from the < unk > of creosaurus and labrosaurus with allosaurus . creosaurus < unk > was named by lull in 1911 for a < unk > from the early cretaceous of maryland . it is now regarded as a dubious theropod . labrosaurus fragilis is a typographical error by marsh ( 1896 ) for labrosaurus ferox . l. < unk > , named by marsh in 1896 for a morrison theropod tooth , which like l. stechowi is now regarded as either ceratosaurus sp . or

this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities . several asian populations formerly thought to be a. hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s once phylogenetic analyses revealed they were unique astraeus species , including a. asiaticus and a. odoratus . research has revealed the presence of several < unk > chemical compounds in the fruit bodies . north american field guides typically rate a. hygrometricus as inedible . <eos>   <eos>   = = taxonomy , naming , and phylogeny = = <eos>   <eos>   because this species resembles the earthstar fungi of geastrum , it was placed in that genus by early authors , starting with christian < unk > persoon in 1801 ( as < unk > , an alternate spelling of geastrum ) . according to the american botanist andrew p. morgan , however , the species differed from those of geastrum in not having open chambers in the young gleba , having larger and branched < unk > threads , not having a true hymenium , and having larger spores . accordingly , morgan set persoon \\'s < unk > < unk > as the type species of his new genus astraeus in 1889 . despite morgan \\'s publication , some authorities in the following decades continued to classify the species in geastrum . the new @-@ zealand based mycologist gordon < unk > cunningham explicitly transferred the species back to the genus geastrum in 1944 , explaining : <eos>   the treatment of this species by certain < unk > well illustrates the pitfalls that lie in wait for those who worship at the shrine of < unk > classification ... the only feature of those outlined in which the species differs from others of geastrum is the somewhat primitive hymenium . in the developing plant the < unk > cavities are separated by < unk > plates so tenuous as to be overlooked by the < unk > worker . each cavity is filled with basidia somewhat irregularly arranged in clusters ( like those of scleroderma ) and not in the definite palisade of the species which have been studied . this difference disappears as maturity is reached , when plants resemble closely the < unk > of any other member of the genus . the < unk > is then unable to indicate any point of difference by which \" astraeus \" may be separated from geastrum , which indicates that the name should be discarded . <eos>   cunningham \\'s treatment was not followed by later authorities , who largely considered astraeus a distinct genus . according to the < unk > authority < unk > , synonyms of astraeus hygrometricus include < unk > < unk > < unk > . ( 1772 ) ; geastrum < unk > < unk > . ( 1822 ) ; geastrum < unk > ( < unk > . ) < unk > . ( 1885 ) ; and astraeus < unk > < unk > ( 1900 ) . <eos>   astraeus hygrometricus has been given a number of < unk > names that allude to its hygroscopic behavior , including the \" < unk > earthstar \" , the \" hygroscopic earthstar \" , the \" barometer earthstar \" , and the \" water @-@ measure earthstar \" . the resemblance to geastrum species ( also known as true earthstars ) accounts for the common name \" false earthstar \" . the specific name is derived from the greek words < unk > ( < unk > ) \" wet \" and < unk > ( < unk > ) \" measure \" . the german mycological society selected the species as their \" mushroom of the year \" in 2005 . <eos>   studies in the 2000s showed that several species from asian collection sites labelled under the specific epithet hygrometricus were actually considerably variable in a number of < unk > and microscopic characteristics . molecular studies of the dna sequences of the < unk > region of the ribosomal dna from a number of astraeus specimens from around the world have helped to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the genus . based on these results , two asian \" hygrometricus \" populations have been described as new species : a. asiaticus and a. odoratus ( synonymous with < unk > \\'s a. < unk > described in 2003 ) . preliminary dna analyses suggests that the european a. hygrometricus described by persoon is a different species than the north american version described by morgan , and that the european population may be divided into two distinct < unk > , from france and from the mediterranean . a 2010 study identified a japanese species , previously identified as a. hygrometricus , as genetically distinct ; it has yet to be officially named . <eos>   a form of the species found in korea and japan , a. hygrometricus var . koreanus , was named by < unk > < unk > in 1958 ; it was later ( 1976 ) published as a distinct species — a. koreanus — by < unk > < unk > . as pointed out by < unk > and colleagues , clarification of the proper name for this taxon must await analysis of a. hygrometricus var . koreanus specimens from the type locality in north korea . <eos>   <eos>   = = description = = <eos>   <eos>   young specimens of a. hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially embedded in the substrate . a smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body , and may be partially encrusted with debris . as the fruit body matures , the mycelial layer tears away , and the outer tissue layer , the exoperidium , breaks open in a star @-@ shaped ( < unk > ) pattern to form 4 – 20 irregular \" rays \" . this simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin < unk > < unk > . the rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment , opening up in high humidity , and closing when the air is dry . this is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue ; the innermost , fibrous layer is hygroscopic , and < unk > or < unk > the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings . this adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of < unk > moisture , and reduce evaporation during dry periods . further , dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind , allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll . <eos>   the fruit body is 1 – 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter from tip to tip when expanded . the exoperidium is thick , and the rays are typically < unk > ( divided into small areas by cracks and crevices ) on the upper surface , and are dark grey to black . the spore case is < unk > ( lacking a stalk ) , light gray to tan color and 1 to 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 2 in ) broad with a felt @-@ like or < unk > ( coated with loose scaly crust ) surface ; the top of the spore case is opened by an irregular slit , tear or pore . the interior of the spore case , the gleba , is white and solid when young , and divided into oval < unk > — a characteristic that helps to distinguish it from geastrum . the gleba becomes brown and

( sterile tissue in the gleba , at the base of the spore sac ) . geastrum tends to have its spore sac opening surrounded by a < unk > or a disc , in contrast with the single < unk > slit of a. hygrometricus . there are also several microscopic differences : in a. hygrometricus , the basidia are not arranged in parallel columns , the spores are larger , and the threads of the capillitia are branched and continuous with the hyphae of the peridium . despite these differences , older specimens can be difficult to distinguish from geastrum in the field . one species of geastrum , g. < unk > , does have thick and brittle rays that are moderately hygroscopic , and could be confused with a. hygrometricus ; however , its spores are smaller than a. hygrometricus , typically about 4 µm in diameter . <eos>   astraeus < unk > is larger , 5 to 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) or more when expanded , and often has a more pronounced < unk > pattern on the inner surface of the rays . it is found in north america and the canary islands . a. asiaticus and a. odoratus are two similar species known from throughout asia and southeast asia , respectively . a. odoratus is distinguished from a. hygrometricus by a smooth outer mycelial layer with few adhering soil particles , 3 – 9 broad rays , and a fresh odor similar to moist soil . the spore ornamentation of a. odoratus is also distinct from a. hygrometricus , with longer and narrower spines that often joined together . a. asiaticus has an outer < unk > surface covered with small granules , and a gleba that is purplish @-@ chestnut in color , compared to the smooth < unk > surface and brownish gleba of a. hygrometricus . the upper limit of the spore size of a. asiaticus is larger than that of its more common relative , ranging from 8 @.@ 75 – 15 @.@ 2 μm . a. koreanus ( sometimes named as the variety a. hygrometricus var . koreanus ; see taxonomy ) differs from the more common form in its smaller size , paler fruit body , and greater number of rays ; microscopically , it has smaller spores ( between 6 @.@ 8 and 9 μm in diameter ) , and the spines on the spores differ in length and morphology . it is known from korea

with buckets on each end of a rope . seeing the reflection of the moon in the water at the bottom of the well , the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick it up . when he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone , the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help . however , this pulls up the other bucket , into which the fox has jumped ,

odds with the tale itself . < unk > farber highlights a number of these discrepancies , and says that the allegory \" does not hold true in any traditional sense \" . amongst the inconsistencies is that the fox , not the wolf , is the figure that argues with and finds fault in the husbandman ; the \" woods of the world \" are not < unk > by the husbandman , in spite of the moralitas suggesting it is applicable to all men ; farber argues that even assuming the moral to be true is problematic , since it apparently suggests that the godly man must < unk > the figure of the judge , and that this does not affect his godly status . furthermore , the absence of the legal discussion and the binding quality of words from the moralitas suggests to farber that the \" intricate legal framework … has no impact whatsoever in resolving the issues with which it is supposed to deal \" . in contrast , < unk > m. bright considers that the moralitas of this tale , as well as several others , create \" an additional sense which co @-@ exists with the literal narrative and extends and < unk > it thematically \" ; treating literal details symbolically and establishing the sense through direct comparisons . <eos>   according to dorothy yamamoto , the significant themes in the tale are \" < unk > and vacancy , substance and illusion \" . the cheese that apparently resides in the well is only an illusion , not a solid object , and similarly the fox creates a surface reconciliation between the wolf and the husbandman , but which betrays his real intentions . through their frequent misuse , words that should convey real value are emptied of meaning . as an example , yamamoto highlights the fox \\'s < unk > on which the wolf and husbandman make their pledge — which body part she says is used by the fox in other tales to blind his < unk > , and is thereby a highly inappropriate object to use . <eos>   <eos>   = = = modern edition = = = <eos>   <eos>   henryson , robert ( 2009 ) . the

successor league to the < unk > as the premier league in the country . he scored eight goals in ten games over the two @-@ month season that lasted from january to march . he helped the team to finish first in the ecaha and retain the cup in 1908 with challenges from ottawa , winnipeg and toronto . the wanderers were cup champions throughout these challenges , so ross became the second player to win the cup with different teams in consecutive years , after jack marshall in 1901 and 1902 . in january 1908 , he participated in the first all @-@ star game in sports history , a benefit for the family of former < unk > defender hod stuart , who died the previous summer . aside from his time with the wanderers , ross repeated his practice of playing for other teams who paid for his services in important matches . for the 1909 season ross demanded a salary of $ 1 @,@ 600 . although he settled for $ 1 @,@ 200 , the average salary of hockey players at the time was $ 600 . ross received a cash bonus of $ 400 to play in a stanley cup challenge against a team from edmonton in december 1908 , in which the wanderers won the two @-@ game , total @-@ goal series 13 – 10 . he finished the season with two goals in nine games . <eos>   <eos>   = = = 1909 – 18 = = = <eos>   <eos>   a new league , the canadian hockey association ( < unk > ) , was formed in late november 1909 . one of the teams , the all @-@ montreal hockey club , hired ross as a playing @-@ manager , but the league only lasted to mid @-@ january 1910 before disbanding . ross , who scored four goals in four games in the < unk > , then signed with the < unk > < unk > of the national hockey association ( nha ) , a league formed in december 1909 , which proved to be the stronger replacement to the ecaha as the highest level of hockey in canada . he received $ 2 @,@ 700 to play in the 1910 season , which lasted from january to march , playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals . before the following season , the nha imposed a salary cap of $ 5 @,@ 000 per team . the players , including ross , were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease , and began looking to form their own league without a cap . ross wrote to the montreal herald , stating \" all the players want is a fair deal ... the players are not trying to < unk > the nha , but we want to know where we get off at . \" the plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the nha . ross scored four goals in eleven games with the wanderers , who finished fourth in the five team league . during a match against the quebec bulldogs on february 25 , 1911 , ross knocked out eddie < unk > in a fight , provoking a massive brawl between the two teams , which the police had to break up . the fight helped to increase the reputation ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent . the following season ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the wanderers improved to second in the league . <eos>   prior to the 1913 – 14 nha season , ross refused to sign a contract for the wanderers , requesting a salary increase . as one of the top players on the team , the wanderers agreed to his demands of $ 1 @,@ 500 for the forthcoming season , in which he finished with four goals and nine points in eighteen games . the next season ross , again concerned with his salary , began negotiating with other players in the nha to leave their teams and form a new league that would offer higher wages . these actions resulted in his suspension in november 1914 by emmett quinn , president of the nha . ross responded by declaring himself a free agent and claiming his contract with the wanderers was no longer valid . consequently , although having no technical power to do so , quinn suspended ross from all organized hockey . the proposed new league failed to materialize and ross applied for < unk > to the nha , which was granted at a meeting of the team owners on december 18 , 1914 . the owners realized if they suspended ross , they would also have to suspend all those he signed , hurting the league . however , ross \\'s actions led to his release by the wanderers . at first he trained with the montreal canadiens , then joined the ottawa senators . <eos>   at the conclusion of the 1914 – 15 season , the senators and wanderers finished with identical records of fourteen wins and six losses . a two @-@ game , total goal series was played to determine the nha league champion who would contest the stanley cup with the pacific coast hockey association winner , the vancouver < unk > . ross , who finished with three goals in sixteen games in the season , scored one goal in the first match against the wanderers , a senators 4 – 0 victory , and though ottawa lost the second game 1 – 0 , they won the series , 4 – 1 . to help the senators stop the wanderers , who were known for their speed , ross created a new system of defence . < unk > \" < unk > bar the door \" , it required three defenders to align themselves across the ice 30 feet in front of the goaltender to stop offensive rushes . this style of defence would later be used in a modified version known as the neutral zone trap , later used widely to stop opposition offensive chances . <eos>   the following year ross , who had eight goals and eight assists in twenty @-@ one games , was the second highest paid player on the team ; his salary of $ 1 @,@ 400 was $ 100 less than frank < unk > made . even so , ross left the team in 1916 , returning to montreal in order to look after his sporting @-@ goods store , and rejoining the wanderers . he scored six goals and had two assists in sixteen games for the team . the wanderers , along with the montreal canadiens , toronto arenas , quebec bulldogs and ottawa senators dissolved the nha and founded the national hockey league ( nhl ) in november 1917 . ross became coach of the wanderers , but a fire on january 2 , 1918 , destroyed their home , the montreal arena , and forced them to fold after four games . however , the nhl insisted the team continue to play , and recorded two additional scheduled matches as < unk > losses for the wanderers , even though the matches were not played . with the wanderers disbanded , ross retired as a player . his nhl career yielded one goal in three games played . <eos>   <eos>   = = managerial career = = <eos>   <eos>   <eos>   = = = 1918 – 36 = = = <eos>   <eos>   ross began his career as a hockey coach in the midst of his playing days , when at age 24 he led the mcgill university < unk > to a 4 – 2 – 1 record during the 1910 – 11 season . following his playing career , ross became a nhl referee . he was hired to coach the hamilton tigers for the 1922 – 23 season , and adopted new methods in training camp that emphasized physical fitness , including work off the ice . however , the tigers finished with a record of six wins and eighteen losses , last in the nhl for the third successive year , and ross did not return the next season . his next coaching appointment arose from meeting boston grocery store magnate charles adams during the 1924 stanley cup finals . before the 1924 season , the nhl awarded adams an expansion team . adams \\' first move was to hire ross as vice president , general manager , coach and scout . adams instructed ross to come up with a nickname portraying an < unk > animal displaying speed , agility and < unk > . with this in mind , ross named the team the boston bruins , after the old english word for a bear . the team \\'s nickname went perfectly with the original colours of brown and yellow , which were the same colours of adams \\' grocery chain , first national stores . <eos>   ross utilized his many hockey connections throughout canada and the united states to sign players . even so , the team started poorly . early in the first season the university of toronto hockey team was in boston for matches against local universities . the team \\'s manager , < unk > < unk > , who later owned and managed the toronto maple leafs , said that his team could easily defeat the bruins — ross \\'s team had won only two of their first fifteen nhl games . this began a feud between < unk > and ross which lasted for over 40 years , until ross \\' death ; while mostly confined to newspaper reports , they refused to speak to each other at nhl board of governor meetings . the bruins finished their first season with six wins in thirty games , one of the worst records in the history of the league . several records were set over the course of the season ; the three home wins are tied for the second fewest ever , and an eleven @-@ game losing streak from december 8 , 1924 , until february 17 , 1925 , set a record for longest losing streak , surpassed in 2004 and now second longest in history . with 17 wins in 36 games the following season , the team greatly improved , and finished one point out of a playoff spot . <eos>   in 1926 the western hockey league , the other top professional hockey league , was in decline . the patrick brothers , who controlled the league , offered to sell the remaining five teams for $ 300 @,@ 000 . ross realized the potential talent available and convinced adams to pay the money . as a result , the bruins acquired the rights to several future hall of fame players , the most notable being defender eddie shore . ross signed goaltender cecil \" tiny \" thompson in 1928 , who was with a team in minnesota , despite never watching him play ; ralph \" < unk > \" weiland was also brought over from minnesota . ross acquired cy < unk > from ottawa and made him a player @-@ assistant @-@ coach while he assumed the role of coach and team manager . on november 20 , 1928 , the bruins moved to a new arena when the boston garden opened . the team played the canadiens who won the match 1 – 0 in front of 16 @,@ 000 fans . the players signed by ross helped the bruins to improve quickly , and they won the stanley cup in 1929 . < unk > retired after the cup win , ross guiding the team to several league records in the 1929 – 30 season . the team won 38 of 44 games for an < unk > winning percentage , the highest in league history ; the five losses tied a record for fewest ever , and the four road losses tied a record for second fewest . the bruins also only finished one game in a tie , a record for fewest ties in a season since the nhl began recording the record in 1926 . one of the longest winning streaks was also set during the season . from december 3 , 1929 , until january 9 , 1930 , the team won fourteen games in a row , a record that lasted until 1982 and now tied for third longest , as of october 2010 . a home winning streak began the same day and lasted for twenty games , until march 18 , 1930 , which was tied for the longest of its kind in 1976 . in 1930 – 31 , the bruins again lost only one home game , which equalled their previous record . <eos>   on march 26 , 1931 , ross substituted a sixth < unk > for goaltender tiny thompson in the final minute of play in a playoff game against the montreal canadiens . although the bruins lost the game 1 – 0 , ross became the first coach to replace his goaltender with an extra attacker , a tactic which became widespread practice in hockey . < unk > aside as coach in 1934 to focus on managing the team , ross hired frank patrick as coach with a salary of $ 10 @,@ 500 , which was high for such a role . however rumours spread during the season that patrick was drinking heavily and not being as strict with the players as ross wanted . after the bruins lost their playoff series with the toronto maple leafs in the 1936 playoffs , the result of an 8 – 1 score in the second game , a newspaper claimed that patrick had been drinking the day of the game and had trouble controlling the team . several days later , ross relieved patrick of his duties and once again assumed the role of coach . <eos>   <eos>   = = = 1936 – 54 = = = <eos>   <eos>   ross took over an improved team . he had recently signed three players , < unk > schmidt , bobby bauer and woody < unk > , who all grew up together in < unk > , ontario , and had them play on the same line , soon nicknamed the < unk > line in reference to the german heritage of all three . along with them , ross had acquired a new goaltender in 1938 , frank brimsek ; after brimsek earned six < unk > in his first eight games , the bruins traded away tiny thompson to allow brimsek to play . with these players the bruins finished first in the league in 1937 – 38 ; ross was named as the second best coach in the league , selected for the end of season all @-@ star second team . the next season the bruins won 36 of 48 games , and won the stanley cup in the playoffs ; ross was named to the first all @-@ star team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games , which is tied for the second fewest in a season . he hired the recently retired < unk > weiland to coach the bruins for the 1939 – 40 nhl season . the bruins would win the cup again in 1941 , and tied their record of only four away losses all season . ross once again took over as coach of the team before the 1941 – 42 season began , as weiland became coach of the < unk > bears of the american hockey league , and led the team to 25 wins in 48 games , which was enough to earn third place in the league . by this time the second world war had caused several bruins players , including the entire < unk > line and goaltender brimsek , to enlist in their respective armed forces . the bruins finished second in the nhl during the 1942 – 43 season with 24 wins in 50 games and ross was again named in the second nhl all @-@ star team as second best coach in the league . the bruins missed the playoffs in 1943 – 44 , the first time in ten years they failed to qualify , but returned to the playoffs the next season , something they did for five straight years . <eos>   in 1949 , ross had signed georges boucher as coach , but boucher did not work well with ross and team president weston adams . looking to hire a new coach in the summer of 1950 , ross < unk > lynn patrick , the son of lester , who had just resigned from the new york rangers after coaching the team to the stanley cup final . lynn had moved his family back to victoria , british columbia , where he grew up as a child , with the intention of coaching the victoria cougars , a team in the minor professional pacific coast hockey league . though reluctant to move back to the eastern united states , lynn was hired by ross after he was offered a salary of $ 12 @,@ 000 . he would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the bruins when ross retired at the end of october 1954 . <eos>   <eos>   = = = legacy = = = <eos>   <eos>   aside from his career in hockey , ross was interested in improving the game . prior to the start of the 1927 – 28 season , the nhl adopted a new style of goal net created by ross . with the back < unk > into a b @-@ shape , it was better designed to catch < unk > and the net was used until 1984 , when a modified version was adopted . he also improved the design of the puck . ross \\' design had < unk > edges , which prevented it bouncing too much , and used synthetic rubber , rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue . along with new york rangers coach frank boucher , ross helped to create the red line , which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone ; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass . more scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with < unk > . in order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television , ross suggested that the red line be striped . <eos>   regarded throughout his playing career as one of the best defenders in hockey , ross was named to the hockey hall of fame in 1949 , selected for his playing career rather than his work as an executive . a ceremony for his induction was held prior to a bruins game on december 2 , 1949 , where he was given his hall of fame scroll and a silver < unk > with the < unk > of the six nhl teams on it . in 1975 he was inducted into the canadian sports hall of fame . along with his two sons he donated the art ross trophy to the nhl in 1947 , to be awarded to the leading scorer in the league \\'s regular season . in 1984 he was posthumously awarded the lester patrick trophy for service to hockey in the united states . <eos>   a descriptive biography entitled art ross : the hockey legend who built the bruins by eric zweig was published by < unk > press in < unk > 2015 . <eos>   <eos>   = = personal life = = <eos>   <eos>   ross also excelled in baseball , football , < unk > and motorcycle racing . before he became a hockey executive , he had a career as a bank clerk and ran a sporting @-@ goods store in montreal . ross had moved to brandon , manitoba , in 1905 at the advice of his parents so he could get a job with a bank , with a salary of $ 600 per year . he gave that career up when he began playing hockey professionally . he was married to < unk > , a native of montreal , and had two sons , art and john . during the second world war , both sons served in the royal canadian air force . after the war ross made his son art the business manager for the bruins . ross was named coach and manager of the boston bruins in 1924 and moved his family to < unk > , massachusetts , a suburb of boston , after being hired . in 1928 , he served as the traveling secretary of the boston braves baseball team , which was owned by bruins owner charles adams . he became a naturalized american citizen on april 22 , 1938 . on august 5 , 1964 , ross died at a nursing home in < unk > , massachusetts , a suburb of boston , at the age of 79 . a sister , both his sons , and three grandchildren survived him . <eos>   <eos>   = = career statistics = = <eos>   <eos>
